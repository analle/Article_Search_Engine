ewarticle ISLAMABAD: In a move to give relief to consumers, sources in the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday that the price of petrol and petroleum products are expected to decrease further from February 1.According to sources, the price of petrol is expected to be slashed by Rs 10 per litre, High Speed Diesel by Rs 8.50 per litre, Light Diesel by Rs 11 per litre, HOBC by Rs 14 per litre, and Kerosene by Rs 12 per litre.Global crude oil prices have fallen by 50 percent since June 2014, and to provide consistent relief to consumers, the Pakistan government has decreased the price of petrol by Rs 29 since the last four months and brought the price of Diesel down by Rs 23 in the same time frame.Fuel crisis in the country began last week when Pakistan State Oil (PSO) was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country´s oil.The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. 










 
ewarticle KARACHI: A strike called by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association has caused a severe shortage of petrol in Karachi, Quetta and several parts of the country.The shortage comes as the government notified a decrease of Rs 3 per litre in the prices of petrol and diesel from Tuesday. Chairman Petroleum and CNG Association Shabir Sulemanji said earlier today that 30 percent of fuel stations in Karachi have run out of petrol and diesel due to the strike, expressing hope that situation would improve by Wednesday.But Geo News correspondent Ali Imran said that by now petrol was available on only about 20 to 25 percent pumping stations  those too most likely on the outskirts of Karachi. He said that there were also reports of fuel stations illegally selling petrol in black at exorbitant rates of up to Rs100 per litre.Read more: Prices of petrol, diesel slashed by Rs3 per litre Some parts of Sindh and Punjab have also begun to feel the effect of the shortage, with fears that the shortage may spiral out of control. The strike by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association, called to protest against sales tax imposed on transportation of oil, is being seen as the main reason for the shortage which is causing great difficulty for consumers.Experts and observers say the effects of the shortage are exacerbated by pumping stations not keeping enough stock and consumers waiting for prices to go down to refill their fuel tanks.                        










"
Impact of Beijing's potential monetary policy easing on Asian markets,"Hong Kong: Asian stocks flip-flopped on Wednesday after China cut interest rates in a bid to restore confidence in its sagging economy, with trading volatile after days of heavy swings across world equities.The dollar edged up in Tokyo, after rebounding from this week´s steep losses in New York as nervous investors searched for safety.Tokyo rose 0.40 percent by the break, bouncing after their worst two-day plunge since 2011, and Seoul added 1.05 percent as China´s move to cut rates and free up cash for banks to lend spurred optimism.But Shanghai swiftly gave up gains in opening deals to fall 3.03 percent by mid-morning, and Hong Kong and Sydney both dropped 0.70 percent.China on Tuesday cut its key interest rate and slashed the amount of money banks must hold in reserve for the second time in as many months in a bid to spur growth and end its worst stock market rout in decades.The People´s Bank of China has already cut interest rates five times since November to spur the slowing economy as concerns mount it may miss its seven percent growth target for the year.Fears of stalling growth in China, the world´s number two economy and key driver of world growth, has sent global markets into a tailspin and investors said the cuts alone may not be enough to stem the losses.""The authorities have not been intervening, they have been allowing stocks to go down in price. Assuming that continues to be the case on Wednesday, I do see a continued fall in prices,"" Komal Sri-Kumar, founder of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, told Bloomberg News.In currency trade, the dollar remained under pressure at 118.96 yen, little changed from 118.84 yen in New York trade Tuesday, but dramatically weaker than the 122.06 yen seen in US trade on Friday.The euro stood at $1.1535 and 137.25 yen in Tokyo, compared with $1.1518 and 136.87 yen in New York overnight.Oil prices held steady ahead of the latest US energy report after heavy losses earlier in the week owing to jitters over China´s faltering economy.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery gained four cents to $39.35 while Brent crude for October rose 11 cents to $43.32.Gold traded at $1,137.66 compared to $1,149.80 late Tuesday.In individual shares, BHP Billiton rose 0.81 percent to Aus$23.54 after the global mining giant announced a 86.2 percent slump in annual net profit after trading closed Tuesday. 










 
ewarticle Hong Kong: A mixed reading on Chinese inflation Thursday kept Asian equities traders on edge in fresh volatility Thursday as markets retreated from a two-day rally, while fears of a US interest rate hike saw safe assets advance.Early selling spread through regional exchanges, with Hong Kong and Shanghai seeing hefty losses, despite Chinese Premier Li Keqiang the day before seeking to shore up confidence in the government´s handling of an economic crisis that has sent global markets plunging.A late tumble on Wall Street provided extra reason to run after a report showing a tighter US jobs market increased speculation the Federal Reserve will pull the trigger on a rate rise at next week´s policy meeting.Thursday´s losses follow thumping gains across the world over the previous two days -- including a 7.7 percent jump in Tokyo Wednesday -- which were helped by Chinese moves to bolster its economy.However, Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic asset allocation at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney, told Bloomberg News: ""Markets will remain volatile until the Fed meeting next week.""Investors are again focusing on the potential US interest rate increase and how it would impact emerging markets.""In Beijing, official figures showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose two percent last month, better than July´s 1.6 percent and beating forecasts of 1.8 percent.However, the producer price index (PPI) -- a crucial measure of costs for goods at the factory gate and a leading indicator of the trend for consumer prices -- slumped at its fastest rate in six years.The figures will do little to ease the struggle authorities have in kickstarting the world´s number two economy and main driver of global growth as it suffers a painful slowdown.""This is a real problem,"" said Zhu Qibing, a Beijing-based analyst at China Minzu Securities Co. ""For a manufacturer, CPI represents its costs because wages rise, and PPI represents the prices of its product. Now profits of enterprises are being further eroded.""

ewarticle Hong Kong: Asian markets slipped Wednesday after more weak US data raised questions about the health of the world´s top economy, while the dollar edged down as an early interest rate rise looks increasingly unlikely.The euro continued to hold its own, with investors hopeful that Greece will be able to hammer out a bailout reform deal with creditors and avert a default.Sydney plunged 1.85 percent, or 109.9 points, to 5,838.6, with big banks leading the decline as hopes of another interest rate cut waned. Seoul closed 0.23 percent lower, giving up 5.04 points to 2,142.63.Hong Kong ended 0.15 percent lower, shedding 42.41 points to 28,400.34, but Shanghai recovered from early losses to close flat -- edging up 0.41 points to 4,476.62.Tokyo was closed for a public holiday.With few major catalysts, regional investors are focusing on the Federal Reserve´s two-day meeting, which wraps up later in the day.While the US central bank will not announce any policy move, its statement will be pored over for any guidance on interest rates.On Tuesday the Conference Board reported its index of consumer confidence tumbled in March instead of rising as expected. Consumers reported growing pessimism about current and short-term US economic conditions.A series of disappointing indicators has fuelled speculation the US central bank will want to wait to increase rates, which have been pegged at zero since 2008. The Fed had signalled a possible rise as early as June, but analysts now expect it in September at the earliest.Wednesday will also see the release of the government´s first estimate on first-quarter economic growth, with analysts forecasting 1.0 percent, down from a 2.2 percent pace in the previous three months.However, on Wall Street Tuesday the Dow added 0.40 percent and the S&P 500 rose 0.28 percent. But the Nasdaq eased 0.10 percent.- Euro holds strength -The diminishing prospect of an early rate increase has weighed on the dollar, which fell to 118.88 yen in New York Tuesday from 119.10 yen earlier in the day in Tokyo. On Wednesday in Asia the greenback was at 118.82 yen.The euro was at $1.0998 and $130.90 against $1.0981 and 130.55 yen in US trade. It was sharply up from $1.0880 and 129.54 yen in Tokyo Tuesday.Even though talks between Greece´s government and its creditors are dragging on, there is hope for an agreement on the bailout that will unlock billions of euros, allowing Athens to avert a default and stay in the eurozone.Investors cheered Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras´ decision to reshuffle his negotiating team, while he has also expressed confidence in a compromise.According to press reports Greece´s hard-left, anti-austerity leadership could also be prepared to adopt some reforms previously rejected, including a reinforced tax collection system, taxing television adverts and ramping up levies on luxury goods.Oil prices inched lower ahead of the release of the latest US supply report.

ewarticle Hong Kong: Asian markets extended their rally this week, while the euro dipped ahead of a much-anticipated European Central Bank policy meeting that is forecast to see it introduce more monetary easing measures.Tokyo added 0.28 percent, or 48.54 points, to end at 17,329.02, Sydney rose 0.49 percent, or 26.56 points, to 5,419.94 and Seoul was flat, dipping a marginal 0.41 points to 1,920.82.Hong Kong rose 0.70 percent, or 170.05 points, to 24,522.63 and Shanghai gained 0.59 percent, or 19.73 points, to 3,343.34. The mainland China index has recovered almost all the losses it made on Monday in reaction to a regulatory crackdown on margin trading.Eyes are firmly on the ECB meeting later Thursday, with expectations high that it will unveil a programme of asset-purchasing, or quantitative easing (QE).Speculation has been rife for several months that more stimulus would be announced as inflation continues to weaken -- prices in the euro area fell in December for the first time in five years.According to analysts at UniCredit, the market is expecting the ECB to unveil a programme worth between 500 and 800 billion euros ($580 to $930 billion).Wall Street took its rally into a third day Wednesday, the Dow ending up 0.22 percent, the S&P 500 adding 0.47 percent and the Nasdaq 0.27 percent higher.With traders placing bets on a vast round of easing the euro has been hammered in the past few weeks, especially as it comes just a few months after the US Federal Reserve wound up its own QE programme and considers an interest rate hike this year.At one point last week the single currency fell below $1.1500 for the first time since late 2003.In afternoon trade Thursday it bought $1.1624 and 136.78 yen compared with $1.1607 and 136.85 yen in US trade.""The euro decision is kind of well telegraphed but euro-dollar does have more to go on the downside,"" Thomas Averill, a managing director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, told Bloomberg News.

ewarticle Hong Kong: Asian markets were relatively calm Friday at the end of a volatile week, with Shanghai and Hong Kong ticking higher after China unveiled a series of steps to shore up its economy, but fears of a US interest rate hike kept dealers on edge.Higher-yielding, or riskier, currencies such as the Malaysian ringgit and South Korean won benefited from a more upbeat outlook, which followed a positive lead from Wall Street, while the Australian dollar edged higher.The safe-haven yen, considered a go-to asset in times of turmoil, retreated.Analysts said world markets seemed to be settling after a roller-coaster ride since China last month devalued its yuan currency, sparking concerns about the world´s number two economy -- the main driver of global growth -- and its leaders´ ability to control the crisis.The broadly upbeat sentiment comes after Beijing sought to reassure investors it was able to maintain high growth, and announced a plan to speed up major construction projects and cut taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises.A set of capital controls to prevent a flight of cash were implemented this week, while analysts said a rise in the offshore yuan Thursday suggested the central bank had intervened to prop it up.Authorities also unveiled a series of measures to prevent huge swings in China´s stock markets, which have seen trillions of dollars wiped off valuations in Shanghai since it hit a peak in mid-June. Among the measures are a ""circuit breaker"" that stops shares being traded after rising or falling by a certain amount.In early trade, Shanghai was up 0.29 percent, Hong Kong added 1.31 percent and Sydney was 0.37 percent higher. Tokyo pared most early losses to end the morning flat.Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Nomura Holdings, told Bloomberg News: ""We seem to be forming a bottom, but uncertainty has yet to be completely dispelled, including what happens with US monetary policy.""Global investors are nervously waiting for next week´s Federal Reserve policy meeting, with uncertainty over whether it will lift interest rates for the first time in nine years or hold fire owing to the recent market turmoil.A hike in borrowing costs would likely hinder investment possibilities and also fan a flight of capital back to the United States in search of better returns, to the detriment of emerging markets.Hopes that bank policymakers will opt not to raise rates supported US stocks, with Wall Street´s three main indexes all ending strongly higher.A less volatile atmosphere saw low-risk assets retreat. The dollar bought 120.82 yen compared with 120.63 yen in New York, while the euro was at $1.1279 compared with $1.1275.And the Australian dollar, which earlier in the week hit a six-year low below 69 US cents, was at 70.72 cents.The ringgit was up 0.13 percent and the won gained 0.82 percent. New Zealand´s dollar, which tanked Thursday after the central bank cut interest rates, edged up 0.3 percent.

ewarticle Hong Kong: Most Asia markets climbed Monday, with Hong Kong advancing for an eighth straight session and Shanghai rallying after another disappointing batch of Chinese data that will add to hopes for fresh easing measures.Wall Street provided another strong lead, boosted by a string of merger announcements last week and a huge asset sale by General Electric (GE).Hong Kong was up 0.41 percent -- adding to the more than 11 percent gain seen over the past seven days -- while Shanghai ticked 1.30 percent higher. Sydney added 0.20 percent and Seoul put on 0.12 percent, but Tokyo retreated 0.13 percent by lunch.In China the customs administration said imports and exports sank in March, the latest figures to show the world´s number two economy continues to struggle. However, they will also reinforce investors´ expectations that authorities will unveil a new round of growth-fuelling policies.Those expectations have powered a rally in Shanghai shares to seven-year highs over the past 12 months, and now mainlanders are jumping into Hong Kong´s market looking for what they consider cheap equities. Hong Kong´s Hang Seng Index has climbed more than 11 percent over the past seven sessions, and is on course for another rise Monday.Turnover hit two successive records last week as traders north of the border make the most of a link-up between the index and Shanghai´s exchange.While the stock connect programme was initially met with little interest, the decision by mainland authorities last month to expand the number of fund-management firms allowed to buy in Hong Kong has seen activity surge.Attention will now turn to the release Wednesday of Chinese economic growth figures for the first three months of the year.In New York the Dow got a bump from GE´s announcement that it will sell $26.5 billion in real estate assets as part of a plan to pare off most of its GE Capital unit over the next 24 months. That came at the end of a week that also saw major mergers including Royal Dutch Shell and FedEx.The Dow climbed 0.55 percent, the S&P 500 rose 0.52 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.43 percent.On currency markets the dollar was at 120.31 yen, compared with 120.30 yen in New York.The euro bought $1.0590 and 127.41 yen against $1.0599 and 127.50 yen.Oil prices edged higher.

Impact of political uncertainty in Greece on Asian financial markets,"Hong Kong: Asian markets rallied and the euro held up Wednesday on hopes of a settlement in Greece´s debt stand-off after it emerged that the country will ask for an extension to its bailout and avoid a painful eurozone exit.Another record close on Wall Street also provided support, although trade was thin with some markets closed and others winding down for the Lunar New Year holiday.Tokyo rose 0.84 percent, Hong Kong added 0.21 percent, Sydney put on 0.61 percent and Singapore was 0.41 percent higher.Shanghai, Seoul and Taipei were closed for public holidays.Greek public television said Tuesday that the new government will apply for further aid from its European partners, although will not sign up to the painful austerity measures imposed on the country.And in an interview with German public broadcaster ZDF Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said: ""We should extend the credit programme by a few months to have enough stability so that we can negotiate a new agreement between Greece and Europe.""The news will come as a relief after two eurozone finance ministers´ meetings in the past week both collapsed without agreement as Athens refused to continue with the bailout that imposed swingeing spending cuts and tax hikes.The apparent change of face also comes days before its financial lifeline package expires, which would leave the country without any cash and unable to pay its bills, leading it to default and almost certainly leave the eurozone.Investors bought up the euro on the reports and it held the gains in Asia. The single currency fetched $1.1404 and 136.02 yen Wednesday, slightly down from $1.1413 and 136.13 yen in New York afternoon but well above the $1.1357 and 134.70 yen quoted in Tokyo earlier Tuesday.The dollar fetched 119.29 yen from 119.29 yen in New York and 118.55 yen in Tokyo on Tuesday.US shares resumed their record-breaking run Tuesday after they were closed Monday for a public holiday.The S&P 500 climbed 0.16 percent to a second straight all-time high, while the Dow added 0.16 percent.

ewarticle Hong Kong: The euro extended its gains against the dollar Tuesday while Asian equities climbed on hopes Greece´s new government will be able to negotiate a bailout deal with the EU and IMF that will avoid it leaving the eurozone.Regional investors took their lead from advances in Europe and New York, where news of Sunday´s Greek election win for anti-austerity party Syriza had been largely factored in, analysts said.Tokyo jumped 1.44 percent by lunch, Sydney added 0.67 percent, Shanghai edged up 0.10 percent, Seoul rose 0.46 percent and Hong Kong was flat.Markets have been buoyed by rhetoric coming out of Athens and its creditors that raises hopes they two sides can reach an agreement over Greece´s repayment of its 240-billion-euro bailout.Syriza had campaigned on renegotiating terms of the lifeline -- which included swingeing spending cuts and painful tax hikes -- and there are concerns it will default on its repayments, leading to its possible exit from the eurozone.But International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said she was prepared to continue its financial support to the country, while some European finance ministers suggested they were willing to talk, as long as Syriza did not demand its debt be wiped out.The messages coming out of Europe helped shares higher. In Europe, equities in London, Paris and Germany all closed with healthy gains, although Athens lost more than three percent.Dow edged 0.03 percent higher, the S&P 500 added 0.26 percent and the Nasdaq put on 0.29 percent.""The Greek elections had the potential to unnerve the market,"" Nader Naeimi, at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.""It´s quite encouraging that the new government and the EU are willing to negotiate. The market is in a risk-on mode.""The euro plunged to as low as $1.1098 at one point in Asia Monday, the lowest level since September 2003, before recovering later in the day to close out in New York at $1.1234.On Tuesday in Asia it bought $1.1250.It also sank to 131.55 yen Monday in Asia before bouncing to end the day at 133.12 yen.

The single currency bought $1.0733 and 128.20 yen against $1.0741 and 128.05 yen on Wall Street.Hong Kong and Shanghai resumed their upward trend after sharp losses Monday that came after China´s stock market regulator tightened rules on trading with borrowed money and increase the supply of shares for short-selling.Confidence was buoyed by Sunday´s cut by the People´s Bank of China in the amount of cash lenders must hold in reserve, the move aimed at helping kick-start the economy, which grew in January-March at its slowest quarterly pace in six years. The next indicator on the state of China´s economy comes with HSBC´s preliminary index of manufacturing activity on Thursday.US traders welcomed that move.

current trends in US oil prices and market predictions 2023,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices remained near 2016 highs in early trading on Thursday, buoyed by a fall in U.S. crude inventories, a weaker dollar and strong demand, but some analysts warned that the recent rally was starting to look overblown.</strongInternational Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were trading at $52.70 per barrel at 0045 GMT, up 19 cents from their last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was 32 cents higher at $51.55 a barrel.Traders said the price rises were largely a result of a drop in U.S. crude oil inventories.Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. crude stocks last week fell by 3.23 million barrels to 532.5 million barrels, marking their third consecutive weekly fall.A weaker dollar, down around 2.4 percent this month against a basket of other currencies, makes dollar-traded fuel imports for countries using other currencies cheaper, also supporting oil prices, traders said.But some analysts said there were also signs that the recent oil price rise, which saw Brent rally 6 percent this month and prices virtually double since February to one-year highs, may be overblown.ANZ bank said that price rises were ""tempered by an increase in crude production of 10,000 barrels per day to 8.75 million barrels per day and the number of active rigs increasing by 9 to 325"".Traders also warned of an ongoing build in refined product stocks in the United States and Asia.With fundamentals weighing both for and against higher prices, many traders and analysts say that a price tag of $50-60 for a barrel of crude was a fair value for oil, reflected in Brent's forward curve which stays within that range until early 2021. 
ewarticle New York: US oil prices shot up to a 2015 peak Wednesday after a slight dip in US oil production sparked talk that the glutted petroleum market could be turning.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for May delivery jumped $3.10 to $56.39 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest closing price since December 23.European benchmark Brent oil for delivery in May rose $1.89 to $60.32 a barrel in London.The gains extended a market rally into a fifth straight day.Earlier in the day, the US Department of Energy reported US oil production fell by 20,000 barrels, or 0.2 percent, to 9.38 million barrels per day, in the week ending April 10.US crude inventories stand at the highest level for this time of year in at least the last 80 years, the DoE said, but the increase last week was smaller than expected.Analysts expressed caution at Wednesday´s price surge.""I think this rally will stall,"" said Matt Smith, an analyst at Schneider Electric. ""We got quite a bit ahead of ourselves here."" Smith said it is likely still too soon for the lower US rig count to meaningfully dent supply.""Yes, there are a couple of data points, but that doesn´t mean the US is not overflowing crude,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Paris-based International Energy Agency cut its supply forecast for non-OPEC countries, citing a lower outlook for US and Canadian production and the ""worsening conflict"" in Yemen.The agency also bumped up by 90,000 barrels per day its forecast for 2015 petroleum demand. The IEA now expects 2015 consumption of 93.6 million barrels per day, up 1.1 million barrels per day for the year. (AFP)

ewarticle LONDON: The collapse in relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran after the Saudi execution of a Shi´ite cleric puts an end to speculation that OPEC could somehow agree production curbs to lift the price of oil anytime soon.A Reuters survey of OPEC production showed on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia ended 2015 with its output at full tilt, with no sign of cutting supply to make room for Iran, which plans to ramp up its own output when international financial sanctions are lifted this year.According to the survey, compiled from shipping data, oil company figures and industry experts, Saudi production for December averaged 10.15 million barrels per day.That means it was above 10 million barrels per day for nine straight months, the longest period of sustained production above that threshold for decades.The determination by the world´s biggest exporter Saudi Arabia to defend its market share despite a global glut has helped drive oil prices to their lowest in 11 years.Meanwhile, the lifting of sanctions on Iran in line with a nuclear agreement is expected to provide the biggest increase in supply of 2016. The world is now producing 1.5 million barrels a day more than it is consuming, and Iran is promising to add another million bpd to supply over the next 12 months.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to agree any caps on production at its annual meeting in Vienna last month, amid acrimony between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the Gulf region´s main Sunni and Shi´ite powers.If there was still any suggestion that the two rivals might somehow overcome their animosity to agree to manage supply this year, it was buried on Monday when Riyadh called off diplomatic ties with Tehran over Iran´s response to the execution of Saudi<br/>Shi´ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr.Several OPEC delegates told Reuters they now saw no chance of any improvement in relations between OPEC members, which have been already very low over the past months.<br/><br/>""This new situation will just make it worse and I see no agreement to be reached within OPEC,"" one representative to OPEC from a member country outside the Gulf region said, on condition of anonymity.

Saudi Arabia exported just shy of eight million barrels of crude oil per day in March -- the highest export volume in more than nine years,"" said analysts at Commerzbank in a note to clients on Tuesday.Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets Singapore, said ""global oversupply with weak demand"" continues to put a cap on prices despite geopolitical unrest raising concerns about a disruption in the Middle East.He said the crude market is already ""used to"" unrest in the region, where Islamic State fighters on Sunday captured the key Iraqi city of Ramadi.Yemen is also engulfed in violence that analysts fear could escalate and draw in neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are backing the warring factions.Yemen is not a major oil-producing country, but its coast forms one side of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the key strategic entry point into the Red Sea through which some 4.7 million barrels of oil pass each day on ships headed to or from the Suez Canal.""Fears that the fighting in Iraq and Yemen could hamper the oil supply have clearly given way to a more sober appraisal, for the past twelve months have demonstrated that such concerns are exaggerated,"" Commerzbank analysts added. ""In actual fact, the oil supply from the region has continued to grow.""Oil supplies from leading OPEC producers Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are already near their highest levels in three decades, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week. Crude futures have fought back a little in recent weeks after prices plummeted more than 60 percent between June and January, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries refused to cut production despite a global glut.The move by the 12-nation OPEC cartel, which pumps about 30 percent of global crude, was widely taken as an attempt to push US shale producers, which have higher costs, out of the market.

ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices remained under pressure in Asia Friday after a huge jump in US crude inventories reinforced projections that a supply glut will persist well into next year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in December was down 24 cents to $41.51 and Brent crude for December was trading four cents higher at $44.10 a barrel at around 0330 GMT.Prices were hammered Thursday after the US Department of Energy reported that commercial crude inventories in the world´s top oil consumer grew by 4.2 million barrels last week, far higher than analyst expectations of an increase of 1.3 million barrels.WTI sank 2.7 percent and Brent fell 3.8 percent after the report, which also showed US crude oil production continued to ramp higher.Global oil demand growth has not been fast enough to soak up the excess in supplies and analysts say a rebalancing of the supply-demand situation is needed for a sustained uptick in prices.Oil prices have plunged by more than half from peaks of over $100 a barrel in mid-2014.""Although global oil demand growth has been exceptionally strong year-to-date, the overall pace of supply side adjustment has been too slow to end a sustained increase in global inventories that we expect to persist through most of 2016,"" British bank Barclays said.It said in a market commentary that US offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico reached its highest level since early 2010 in August and is expected to remain strong although at a slower pace into 2016 ""as several more new fields begin to produce"".Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have also kept production high in an aggressive bid to retain market share.OPEC´s collective production has stabilised at around 31.5 million barrels per day in recent months, Barclays said, but this is still more than its output ceiling of 30 million barrels per day.

That is up more than a third from a low hit in January, when prices fell to levels not seen since 2003.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were trading at $36.63 a barrel, up 71 cents from the last close and 40 percent above lows touched in February.""It looks at this stage as if it (oil) has formed a little bit of a bottom and perhaps we're going to see a sustained price in the $30s, maybe trending back up to $40 dollars at some point,"" said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at OptionsXpress.Le Brun said an improved economic outlook was pushing prices: ""The macro picture takes all corners of the globe into account, and those corners seem to be improving ... and that's where I'm seeing the oil price tick higher.""Analysts said that strong US payroll data had pushed markets on Friday and early Monday, but that attention was now shifting to Asia.Morgan Stanley said on Monday that China's parliament, the National People's Congress, which opens its annual session this week listed ""to ease market barriers for transport, oil, and gas"" among key policy targets this year.On the supply side, US energy firms cut oil rigs for an 11th week in a row to the lowest level since December 2009, data showed on Friday, as producers slash costs.Drillers removed eight oil rigs in the week ended March 4, bringing the total count down to 392, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said.Beyond a tightening supply outlook, traders said a shift in sentiment was also lifting prices as they shut down short positions and abandoned bets on further falls in prices.Trading data shows that the number of managed short positions on WTI contracts - which would benefit from lower prices - have fallen more than a quarter since mid-February, with many new long positions betting on rising prices being opened.Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets said ""there's a good prospect that Brent could hit $40 ... (it) could easily do it in the next trading session."""
current wholesale sugar prices in Karachi,"KARACHI: Wholesale market rates for sugar dropped to less than Rs 50 per kg following the resumption of sugar cane crushing by sugar mills in Sindh.Within two days, the rate dropped by Rs 1.70 to Rs 49.80 per kg in Karachi Whole Sale Market.According to dealers, the resumption of sugar cane crushing by the mills stabilised the supply to the market with an immediate effect on price as well.Industry experts said that the quality of sugar cane is excellent in Sindh and approximately 100 kg of sugar cane can produce 11 kg of sugar.

ewarticle strong>NEW DELHI: India plans to introduce a 25 percent tax on sugar exports to maintain local supplies, the government said on Thursday, a move that could further push up global prices of the sweetener and boost shipments from Thailand.</strongSugar output in India, the world's no. 2 producer behind Brazil, is expected to decline this year due to a drought in major growing regions, while global prices have risen to two-and-a-half year highs.Food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the levy was aimed at curbing the country's exports and would help keep local prices under control in the world's top consumer of sugar.""There is an increasing trend in the price of sugar in the international market. Traders may increase the export of sugar to make profit,"" Paswan tweeted on Thursday evening.Traders and experts said the new tax could push up global sugar prices, even though India was already expected to become a net importer in the year from Oct. 1 following back-to-back drought years.""Since we are the world's second largest sugar producer there could be a 5 percent impact on global prices but not more,"" said Aurobinda Prasad, vice president research, Kotak Commodities.India exported 2.9 million tonnes of sugar in 2015/16, accounting for 5.3 percent of world exports, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) figures.In a May report, the USDA already forecast sharply reduced exports from India this year of just 1 million tonnes, which would be the lowest since the 2009/10 crop year.""With rising white sugar prices and the weakening rupee, Indian mills could have signed export deals with Sri Lanka. That won't happen now,"" said a Singapore-based trader.Global sugar prices have also been buoyed by cold temperatures in parts of Brazil and growing demand.""Markets were not expecting exports from India but the move to tax sugar exports will definitely have a temporary impact on global prices,"" said a Delhi-based sugar industry expert.He said the plan to tax exports is better than the country's previous moves to ban overseas sales.The move would help rival exporters Thailand and Brazil, said a Mumbai-based trader.""Thailand will benefit more since it has been competing with India in the white sugar market. It also has freight advantages in catering to Asian consumers,"" the trader said.

current oil price trends and economic outlook,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices were stable in early trading on Monday, with global oversupply and slowing economic growth weighing on markets but prospects of falling production lending some support.</strongUS crude futures were trading at $38.41 per barrel at 0239 GMT, down 10 cents from their last settlement.But international Brent futures were up 6 cents at $40.45 a barrel.While Morgan Stanley said that oil prices had likely bottomed out, it warned that a slowing economy and high production would prevent sharp rises.""Oil prices now seem to have bottomed, even though they are likely to stay subdued for the rest of this year before starting to move higher in 2017,"" the US bank said, adding that cheap oil had not provided the economic boost to growth that many had hoped for.""When oil prices are falling below production costs, the income gains for consumers will be smaller than the costs to producers and falling oil prices become a negative-sum game,"" it said.For 2016, the bank said it was ""no longer looking for an acceleration in 2016 GDP growth"" and that the risk of a global recession was now 30 percent.Following a 70 percent price rout between mid-2014 and early 2016, oil markets are in flux.Many analysts expect a modest price recovery, while others see another slump.The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Friday said that oil prices had bottomed out due to US and other output cuts outside the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).The US rig count fell for a 12th straight week last week to a total of 386, its lowest since December 2009 as drillers continue to slash capital expenditure.Others, like Goldman Sachs, warn that ongoing global overproduction, which continues to see over 1 million barrels of crude produced in excess of demand every day, will pull prices back down again.So far, demand in core markets like China remains strong.China's January-February refinery throughput rose 4.6 percent compared to the same period a year earlier to 87.08 million tonnes (10.59 million barrels per day), official data showed on Saturday.The data release came shortly after China reported record daily crude imports of 8 million barrels per day.In traded markets, sentiment leans towards higher prices, with the amount of managed short positions open for US crude, which would profit from falling prices, down over 40 percent since mid-February, while the amount of trades betting on price increases stands near record highs.""The shift in sentiment in commodity markets continues to gather strength ... The worst may be over for commodity markets,"" ANZ bank said. 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices dipped in early Asian trade on Monday as rising production in the Middle East outweighed falling US output and the recent slide in the dollar, which has been supporting crude.</strongBrent futures were trading at $47.05 (32 pounds) per barrel at 0028 GMT on Monday, down 32 cents from their last settlement. US crude was down 28 cents at $45.64 a barrel.Analysts said rising output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and especially the Middle East was outweighing supportive factors such as an ongoing, albeit slow, fall in U.S. output and a sliding dollar, which makes it cheaper for countries using other currencies to import dollar-traded fuel.""The weaker dollar failed to excite investors in the crude oil markets,"" ANZ bank said, citing a rise in OPEC-output as the main downward driver for prices.The dollar has fallen over 6 percent this year against a basket of other leading currencies.French bank BNP Paribas said that a recent oil rally, with prices jumping almost a third since April, was largely driven by sentiment and lacked physical fundamentals.""The recent rally in oil prices ... appears to have little to do with fundamentals,"" it said.""We see the recent rally as sowing the seeds of its own demise, and extending our recommendation to protect against short-term downside risk.""OPEC-supplies rose to 32.64 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, from 32.47 million bpd in March, according to a Reuters survey based on shipping data and information from sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.That almost matches January's 32.65 million bpd, when Indonesia's return to OPEC boosted production to records.Despite Monday's lower prices, other analysts are growing confident that a near-two-year rout in oil has ended, and many have raised their price forecasts.The chief of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil prices may have bottomed out, providing the health of the global economy does not pose a concern.""In a normal economic environment, we will see the price direction is rather upwards than downwards,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Sunday.Non-OPEC output is set to fall by more than 700,000 bpd this year, the biggest decline in around 20 years, he said.With global oil demand seen growing by 1.2 million bpd this year, the draw in global stockpiles will start soon, helping push up prices, he said. 
ewarticle London: Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as the market seeks to build on strong gains in April following massive falls earlier in the year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in June won 56 cents to $59.49 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for June won 47 cents to stand at $66.93 a barrel in London midday deals.After slumping at the start of the year, oil prices rose by about a fifth in value during April owing to several factors including concerns about unrest in Yemen, the weakening dollar and fewer US rigs in operation, analysts said.However, prices remain well down after plunging almost 60 percent between June and the start of 2015 on the back of a global supply glut and ramped up production.""Crude oil producers in the US have significantly cut back output in an attempt to address the significant supply overhang which has exerted downward pressure on... prices since June last year,"" Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokers said on Tuesday.The International Monetary Fund has said that Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.""Saudi Arabia seem committed to defending their market share and have even increased output to over 10 million barrels per day in April,"" said Kamal.""Support for higher crude prices has partly come from a weaker dollar,"" he added.A weaker dollar makes oil priced in the US unit cheaper for holders of others currencies, boosting demand.

ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices dipped in early Asian trading on Tuesday on signs that production in the Middle East is continuing to rise, countering falls in U.S. output and threatening to keep a global supply overhang in place for longer.</strongThe international Brent crude benchmark was trading at $45.68 per barrel at 0100 GMT, down 15 cents from its last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 6 cents at $44.72 a barrel.The dips came as Iraq, the second biggest exporter within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was the latest OPEC-member to announce its exports were rising, reporting oil shipments from southern fields at an average rate of 3.364 million barrels per day (bpd) in April.That was higher than the March average of 3.286 million and close to its November record of 3.37 million bpd.""Energy was weaker. Concerns over rising OPEC supply were raised after Iraq announced it had shipped 3.36 million bpd in April,"" ANZ bank said on Tuesday.Production in OPEC´s biggest exporter, Saudi Arabia, was 10.15 million bpd in April, but sources have said it may rise to near-records of 10.5 million bpd in coming weeks.Adding to surging Middle East output is Iran which, relieved of crippling sanctions in January, has increased its exports to almost 2 million bpd currently from little over 1 million bpd at the start of the year, with sales especially to South Korea soaring.The surging supplies from the Middle East counter falling U.S. output, where production has declined from a peak of around 9.6 million bpd in June 2015, to below 9 million bpd now, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data.""It was the falling U.S. production that helped lift prices earlier this year, so if a surge in Middle East output now counters the U.S. decline, then we could well be in for another downward correction in oil markets,"" one trader said.Crude futures surged by almost a third in April, and they have recovered over 70 percent from decade lows reached in early 2016.""A weaker dollar, falling U.S. oil production, improving economic data from China, combined with large speculative positions fuelled the rally.Analysts, however, have cautioned that inventories remain high and oversupply persists,"" Singapore Exchange (SGX) said on Tuesday in its monthly report. 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices remained near 2016 highs in early trading on Thursday, buoyed by a fall in U.S. crude inventories, a weaker dollar and strong demand, but some analysts warned that the recent rally was starting to look overblown.</strongInternational Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were trading at $52.70 per barrel at 0045 GMT, up 19 cents from their last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was 32 cents higher at $51.55 a barrel.Traders said the price rises were largely a result of a drop in U.S. crude oil inventories.Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. crude stocks last week fell by 3.23 million barrels to 532.5 million barrels, marking their third consecutive weekly fall.A weaker dollar, down around 2.4 percent this month against a basket of other currencies, makes dollar-traded fuel imports for countries using other currencies cheaper, also supporting oil prices, traders said.But some analysts said there were also signs that the recent oil price rise, which saw Brent rally 6 percent this month and prices virtually double since February to one-year highs, may be overblown.ANZ bank said that price rises were ""tempered by an increase in crude production of 10,000 barrels per day to 8.75 million barrels per day and the number of active rigs increasing by 9 to 325"".Traders also warned of an ongoing build in refined product stocks in the United States and Asia.With fundamentals weighing both for and against higher prices, many traders and analysts say that a price tag of $50-60 for a barrel of crude was a fair value for oil, reflected in Brent's forward curve which stays within that range until early 2021."
Impact of yen's rise on Tokyo stocks and global markets,"TOKYO: Tokyo stocks opened up 0.24 percent on Friday, aided by a lower yen and higher New York shares following a solid US retail sales report.The Nikkei 225 index at the Tokyo Stock Exchange added 48.81 points to 20,431.78 at the start.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.22 percent after a stronger-than-expected US retail sales report suggested American consumers are gaining confidence after a sluggish first quarter.The dollar held up early Friday, buying 123.58 yen against 123.45 yen in New York late Thursday.A lower yen is positive for Japanese exporters as it increases profits when repatriated.The euro drifted lower to $1.1244 and 138.93 yen from $1.1260 and 139.00 yen in US trade as investors fretted over troubled Greek negotiations with official creditors.

ewarticle Hong Kong: Most Asia markets climbed Monday, with Hong Kong advancing for an eighth straight session and Shanghai rallying after another disappointing batch of Chinese data that will add to hopes for fresh easing measures.Wall Street provided another strong lead, boosted by a string of merger announcements last week and a huge asset sale by General Electric (GE).Hong Kong was up 0.41 percent -- adding to the more than 11 percent gain seen over the past seven days -- while Shanghai ticked 1.30 percent higher. Sydney added 0.20 percent and Seoul put on 0.12 percent, but Tokyo retreated 0.13 percent by lunch.In China the customs administration said imports and exports sank in March, the latest figures to show the world´s number two economy continues to struggle. However, they will also reinforce investors´ expectations that authorities will unveil a new round of growth-fuelling policies.Those expectations have powered a rally in Shanghai shares to seven-year highs over the past 12 months, and now mainlanders are jumping into Hong Kong´s market looking for what they consider cheap equities. Hong Kong´s Hang Seng Index has climbed more than 11 percent over the past seven sessions, and is on course for another rise Monday.Turnover hit two successive records last week as traders north of the border make the most of a link-up between the index and Shanghai´s exchange.While the stock connect programme was initially met with little interest, the decision by mainland authorities last month to expand the number of fund-management firms allowed to buy in Hong Kong has seen activity surge.Attention will now turn to the release Wednesday of Chinese economic growth figures for the first three months of the year.In New York the Dow got a bump from GE´s announcement that it will sell $26.5 billion in real estate assets as part of a plan to pare off most of its GE Capital unit over the next 24 months.

Relevant: What is the current trend of world oil prices?,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices surged during the start of 2016 trading as relations between top crude producers Saudi Arabia and Iran deteriorated, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions, though weak Asian manufacturing data kept a lid on bullish expectations.</strongSaudi Arabia, the world´s biggest oil exporter, cut diplomatic ties with Iran on Sunday in response to the storming of its embassy in Tehran.The diplomatic row between the two major oil producers escalated following Riyadh´s execution of a prominent cleric on Saturday.Global oil benchmark Brent climbed more than a dollar to a high of $38.50 per barrel on Monday, before easing back to $38.10 at 0350 GMT, still up over 2 percent.US crude´s West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were up 77 cents, or 2.08 percent, at $37.81 a barrel.Oil traders said the crisis between Saudi Arabia, also the world´s second-largest oil producer, and Iran, which holds some of the largest proven oil reserves, was pushing up prices.The clash between the two Middle Eastern rivals also comes as Iran hopes to ramp up oil exports following the expected removal of sanctions against it after reaching a deal over its alleged nuclear weapons development programme.""With increased geopolitical tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the market has put a premium on prices just when markets opened (in 2016),"" brokerage Phillip Futures said on Monday.Despite Monday´s jump, oil prices are down by two-thirds since mid-2014 on ballooning oversupply as producers including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States pump between 0.5 million and 2 million barrels of oil every day in excess of demand. 
ewarticle London: Oil prices nudged higher on Friday, further recovering from a steep dive seen mid-week, although demand is set to remain shackled by a global supply glut, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in May edged up one cent to $50.80 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for May gained 27 cents to $56.84 around midday in London.WTI and Brent sank 3.6 percent on Wednesday after the US Department of Energy said commercial inventories in the world´s biggest economy hit a record high last week.That came after Saudi Arabia´s Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said his country´s production had hit an all-time high of 10.3 million barrels a day in March.Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group, has said this week that rising imports of US crude oil could indicate improved demand prospects in the world´s largest oil consumer or concerns about supply tightening.Price support has meanwhile come from events concerning major oil producer Iran.Analysts attributed steep gains at the start of the week to investors concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.The United States on Thursday warned that sanctions on Iran will be lifted in stages as a nuclear deal is implemented, after Tehran demanded they be removed as soon as it comes into force.""Geopolitical factors remain a constant worry for investors with concerns regarding Iran´s nuclear programme potentially leading to ongoing volatility in the crude oil market,"" said Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokerage.

ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices remained under pressure in Asia Friday after a huge jump in US crude inventories reinforced projections that a supply glut will persist well into next year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in December was down 24 cents to $41.51 and Brent crude for December was trading four cents higher at $44.10 a barrel at around 0330 GMT.Prices were hammered Thursday after the US Department of Energy reported that commercial crude inventories in the world´s top oil consumer grew by 4.2 million barrels last week, far higher than analyst expectations of an increase of 1.3 million barrels.WTI sank 2.7 percent and Brent fell 3.8 percent after the report, which also showed US crude oil production continued to ramp higher.Global oil demand growth has not been fast enough to soak up the excess in supplies and analysts say a rebalancing of the supply-demand situation is needed for a sustained uptick in prices.Oil prices have plunged by more than half from peaks of over $100 a barrel in mid-2014.""Although global oil demand growth has been exceptionally strong year-to-date, the overall pace of supply side adjustment has been too slow to end a sustained increase in global inventories that we expect to persist through most of 2016,"" British bank Barclays said.It said in a market commentary that US offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico reached its highest level since early 2010 in August and is expected to remain strong although at a slower pace into 2016 ""as several more new fields begin to produce"".Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have also kept production high in an aggressive bid to retain market share.OPEC´s collective production has stabilised at around 31.5 million barrels per day in recent months, Barclays said, but this is still more than its output ceiling of 30 million barrels per day. 










 
ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices rebounded in Asia Monday but analysts said they remain weighed by a crude oversupply and fresh worries about the world economy after the Federal Reserve decided last week against raising interest rates.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October, which expires on Tuesday, rose 15 cents to $44.83 and Brent crude for November was up 10 cents at $47.57 a barrel in late-morning trade.Oil stockpiles held by Saudi Arabia, the world´s biggest crude exporter, climbed to a record, Bloomberg News reported.It said the country´s commercial petroleum stockpiles advanced to 320 million barrels, the highest since at least 2002, citing data on Sunday on the website of the Riyadh-based Joint Organisations Data Initiative.Fresh worries have also emerged about the health of the global economy and its impact on oil demand after the Fed, the US central bank, held off raising benchmark interest rates last week.Fed chief Janet Yellen said that bank policymakers cited the ongoing slowdown in China and recent turmoil on world markets as playing a role in the decision.""Indeed, the Fed´s hesitancy only appears to have reinforced investors´ worries about the global economy, rather than reassure them,"" Capital Economics said in a commentary. 










 
ewarticle London: Fragile financial markets are grappling with wild swings in world oil prices, unnerved by uncertainty over global supplies and the demand outlook from China.By the close of business Monday, the price had shot up 27 percent in just three days for the US benchmark contract, West Texas Intermediate for October delivery, rebounding from six and a half year lows.But they skidded again Tuesday when weak Chinese manufacturing data cemented concerns over demand from the world´s biggest commodities consumer.Later in the week oil prices got a boost from the European Central Bank, which on Thursday held out the prospect of yet more stimulus for the eurozone economies if needed.By the end of the week, crude oil prices were trading in London on Friday evening barely changed.Brent North Sea crude sold at $49.95 a barrel -- down from $50.17 a week earlier. The WTI contract traded at $46.22, up from $45.22.Crude oil, the world economy´s most important raw material, has roughly halved in price in a year.""The fall in commodity prices has looked particularly dramatic because it has included oil,"" said Julian Jessop, chief global economist and head of commodities at London-based research group Capital Economics.While many raw materials have been declining in price since 2011 as China´s booming economy began to slow, oil´s price had been propped up by a perceived threat to supply after the Arab Spring, Jessop said in an interview.""Once the concerns about the potential threat to supply from the Arab Spring disappeared and were replaced by the reality of massive oversupply because of the shale revolution in the United States and OPEC´s response of keeping production high when people had thought it might cut, then oil tanked,"" the analyst said.Keeping pressure on oil prices, Iraq has managed to boost production this year by 1.5 million barrels per day despite the conflict with extremists including Daesh group and Iran is set to raise exports as sanctions are lifted after an agreement was reached over its nuclear programme.Despite the uncertainty on commodity markets, the price of gold -- a safe haven -- lost its shine over the past week, hurt by a rally in the US dollar.The precious metal also lost its lure as a haven at as volatile Chinese markets took a holiday on Thursday and Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.On the London Bullion Market, gold was trading at $1,118.25 dollars an ounce Friday against $1.135 dollars a week before.

Why is there a petrol shortage in Pakistan?,"KARACHI: A strike called by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association has caused a severe shortage of petrol in Karachi, Quetta and several parts of the country.The shortage comes as the government notified a decrease of Rs 3 per litre in the prices of petrol and diesel from Tuesday. Chairman Petroleum and CNG Association Shabir Sulemanji said earlier today that 30 percent of fuel stations in Karachi have run out of petrol and diesel due to the strike, expressing hope that situation would improve by Wednesday.But Geo News correspondent Ali Imran said that by now petrol was available on only about 20 to 25 percent pumping stations  those too most likely on the outskirts of Karachi. He said that there were also reports of fuel stations illegally selling petrol in black at exorbitant rates of up to Rs100 per litre.Read more: Prices of petrol, diesel slashed by Rs3 per litre Some parts of Sindh and Punjab have also begun to feel the effect of the shortage, with fears that the shortage may spiral out of control. The strike by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association, called to protest against sales tax imposed on transportation of oil, is being seen as the main reason for the shortage which is causing great difficulty for consumers.Experts and observers say the effects of the shortage are exacerbated by pumping stations not keeping enough stock and consumers waiting for prices to go down to refill their fuel tanks.

The minister cited the recent decline in petroleum prices and delay in a shipment as reasons for the shortage.He said situation would improve as soon as shipment reached Pakistan. Sources told Geo News hat due to financial restraints the Pakistan State Oil has been unable import petrol. 










 
ewarticle ISLAMABAD: In a move to give relief to consumers, sources in the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday that the price of petrol and petroleum products are expected to decrease further from February 1.According to sources, the price of petrol is expected to be slashed by Rs 10 per litre, High Speed Diesel by Rs 8.50 per litre, Light Diesel by Rs 11 per litre, HOBC by Rs 14 per litre, and Kerosene by Rs 12 per litre.Global crude oil prices have fallen by 50 percent since June 2014, and to provide consistent relief to consumers, the Pakistan government has decreased the price of petrol by Rs 29 since the last four months and brought the price of Diesel down by Rs 23 in the same time frame.Fuel crisis in the country began last week when Pakistan State Oil (PSO) was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country´s oil.The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. 










 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Pakistan will lower the sulphur content of diesel imports from January next year, in line with a global shift toward cleaner fuels, said two sources familiar with the matter.</strongAs vehicle numbers in Asia have surged, countries across the region, including China, India and Vietnam, have adopted more stringent sulphur requirements for their fuels in recent years to cap emissions.Pakistan will require diesel fuel with 500 parts per million (ppm) sulphur starting from January 2017 from the current 5,000 ppm sulphur gasoil, the sources said this week.Pakistan and Indonesia are some of the few remaining Asian countries still using high-sulphur gasoil.With the shift, the South Asian nation will be on par in terms of sulphur standards with Bangladesh, Vietnam and Myanmar.State-owned Pakistan State Oil Co (PSO), the country's largest oil products importer, could not be immediately reached for comment.But the country's refineries are still not completely ready to meet the change in sulphur standards, one of the sources familiar with the matter said.About 40 percent of Pakistan's refineries have upgraded their units to produce the low sulphur diesel while the remaining refineries are still working to finish units to reduce the amount of sulphur in the fuel, the source said.The country's refineries use outdated hydro-skimming equipment and desperately need updating, only surviving due to a favourable tax regime, Pakistan's petroleum minister told Reuters last year.PSO has a long-standing term contract with Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) to import about 2.2 to 2.5 million tonnes of high sulphur gasoil every year.KPC has agreed to supply diesel with 500 ppm sulphur to PSO from next year, the two sources close to the matter said.PSO rarely imports gasoil in the spot market except for summer when it needs the fuel for power generation. So, the shift in sulphur specification is not expected to have a major impact on trade flows, middle distillates traders said.Pakistan is also moving towards 92-octane gasoline from November and is phasing out imports of 87-octane gasoline, one of the sources said.PSO is looking to potentially sign long-term contracts for gasoline cargoes, though this is not firm, the source added. It currently imports about 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of gasoline every month through the spot market. 
ewarticle strong>ISLAMABAD: The government has set a target of domestic production of 43.8 million barrels of crude oil and 1.51 trillion cubic feet gas for the next fiscal year.</strong>    The demand and supply gap in both oil and gas sectors will be filled through import of petroleum products, Radio Pakistan reported officials as saying.The indigenous gas supply will be supplemented through LNG imports to the tune of 4.5 million tones. They said the annual production of crude oil stood at 32.03 million barrels in the outgoing fiscal year.The officials said a total of one hundred and sixteen oil and gas wells will be drilled by the exploration and production companies in the next fiscal year to enhance the domestic oil and gas production.Giving details of the projects of Sui Northern and Sui Southern Gas Company Limited, the officials said the two companies plan to add over four hundred thousand new consumers to their systems.In addition, the gas companies have also plans to lay down about six thousand kilometer of new transmission pipelines in their networks."
current trends in Brent crude oil prices,"London: World oil prices rose Thursday on the back of the weaker dollar, but gains were capped after US crude reserves swelled again to a record high.In midday London deals, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery advanced 82 cents to $58.36 a barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April added 52 cents to $48.69 a barrel.""Despite the bearish oil inventories report yesterday, crude oil prices rebounded in early trade this morning supported by a slightly softer US dollar,"" said Sucden brokers analyst Myrto Sokou on Thursday.""Brent futures recovered and climbed higher towards $59 per barrel while WTI futures rose above $48.50 per barrel.""The weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated crude cheaper for buyers using stronger currencies, which tends to stimulate demand and prices.Crude futures had finished mixed Wednesday after a key report showed US crude stockpiles had struck another record high, adding to an oversupplied global market.The US Department of Energy said crude oil inventories surged by 4.5 million barrels in the week to March 6 to 448.9 million.That was the highest level since the beginning of the weekly data series in 1982.Crude prices lost some 60 percent of their value to decline to about $40 between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and the strong dollar.Prices have since rebounded somewhat following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.Elsewhere, investors were monitoring the progress of talks between the United States and other major Western powers and Iran on Tehran´s contested nuclear programme as a deadline at the end of March nears.The Islamic republic has been crippled by a series of UN and US sanctions, including on crude exports, aimed at bringing an end to its nuclear drive, which the West says is being used to develop atomic weapons. Iran denies the allegations.""Prices are likely to remain in a tight range for the next two weeks until the market gets more clarity on the ongoing negotiations between Iran and the US over the lifting of sanctions,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy EY.

ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices rose in Asian trade on Friday, setting crude futures on course for one of their biggest weekly gains this year, as sentiment has become more upbeat despite ongoing oversupply.</strongInternational benchmark Brent crude futures were trading at $45.09 per barrel at 0054 GMT, up more than half a<br/>dollar from their last settlement.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 52 cents at $43.70 a barrel. With Brent up 8 percent since Monday and WTI 12 percent higher since April 18, this week is set for some of the steepest price rallies so far this year, and crude is up by more than two-thirds since its 2016 lows between January and February.Traders said that sentiment in the entire commodity complex had turned more confident, with new cash being put into the market by investors, lifting prices.Another factor has been producers taking advantage of higher prices by locking in production. ""We would expect producers in the U.S. taking every opportunity to aggressively hedge as soon as there is opportunity when oil prices recover for short periods of time,"" French investment bank Natixis said.Falling output, especially in the United States, where many producers are shutting down following an up to 70 percent price<br/>rout since 2014, is also helping to lift the market.Natixis said it expected U.S. oil production to drop by at least 500,000 to 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, compared with 2015, and by another 500,000 bpd in 2017.Despite the recent rally, oil markets remain oversupplied as<br/>between 1 and 2 million barrels of crude are being pumped out of the ground every day in excess of demand, leaving storage tanks around the world filled to the rims with unsold fuel. 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Brent crude prices fell to fresh 11-year lows on Thursday as fresh concerns over China's economy added to huge storage overhangs, near-record production and slowing demand that have already pummelled prices.</strongChina accelerated the devaluation of the yuan on Thursday, sending currencies across the region reeling and domestic stock markets tumbling, as investors feared the Asian giant was kicking off a virtual trade war against its competitors. Trading on its stock markets was suspended for the rest of the day.Global oil prices have crashed 70 percent since mid-2014 as near record output from major producers like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and North America create a ballooning overhang that has left storage tanks around the world struggling to cope with the excess oil.At the same time, demand is slowing, especially in Asia where the biggest economy and energy consumer, China, is seeing the slowest economic growth in a generation.Global benchmark Brent crude futures fell to new 11-year lows of $33.09 per barrel on Thursday, undercutting a low from a day earlier, although prices edged back to $33.52 per barrel by 0213 GMT.Traders said a dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which might normally be seen as posing a risk to oil supplies, may actually be bearish as it all but eliminates cooperation over production between the two OPEC members.""Neither one of them (Saudi Arabia or Iran) is going to voluntarily cede a single barrel to the other, so it arguably makes a coordinated production cut even less likely than it has been,"" one Middle East oil trader said.In the United States, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures set fresh 2009 lows of $32.77 per barrel, with prices crawling back to $33.25 by 0213 GMT.Analysts said that the huge U.S. storage overhang was the main reason for falling WTI crude.""Data suggest gasoline and distillate fuel stockpiles increased 10.6 million barrels and 6.3 million barrels, respectively, last week. The rise in gasoline and distillate inventory more than offset the fall in crude oil inventory levels by 5.09 million barrels to (still near record) 482.3 million barrels last week,"" ANZ bank said.The huge storage overhang means that even if U.S. production falls this year as drillers succumb to low prices, it will take many months to work down excess supplies.With the global economy looking shaky due to China's slowdown, traders said the outlook for oil remains for cheap prices for much of this year. 
ewarticle LONDON: Oil prices slid more than 4 percent to new 11-year lows on Wednesday as the row between Saudi Arabia and Iran made any cooperation between major exporters to cut output even more unlikely.The furore over Saudi Arabia´s execution of a Shi´ite cleric has stripped nearly 8 percent off the price of oil in the last three trading days, killing speculation that OPEC members might agree to production cuts to lift prices.""There are rising stockpiles and the tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia make any deal on production unlikely,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.Evidence of slowing economic growth in China and India has meanwhile fuelled fears that even strong demand elsewhere may not be enough to mop up the excess crude that has resulted from near-record production over the last year.Benchmark Brent crude futures were at $35.07 a barrel at 1318 GMT, down $1.58 on the day, and reached their lowest since early July 2004, having staged their largest one-day drop in percentage terms in nearly five weeks.US crude futures were down $1.25 cents at $34.72 a barrel after slipping 79 cents the previous day.Oil has slumped from above $115 in June 2014 as shale oil from the United States has flooded the market, while falling prices have prompted some producers to pump even harder to compensate for lower revenues and to keep market share.Adding to this oversupply, Iranian oil exports are widely expected to increase in 2016 as Western sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear programme are lifted.""Shale production and increasing capacity from countries like Russia who need to protect revenue combined with expectations of further Iranian supply mean actual production as well as expectations of future production are rising,"" Hewson said.Still, a senior Iranian oil official said the country could moderate oil export increases once sanctions are lifted to avoid putting prices under further pressure.Also feeding into broad market weakness, a survey showed that China´s services sector expanded at its slowest pace in 17 months in December, following on from weak factory data on Monday which also knocked markets globally.The People´s Bank of China set a weaker midpoint for the yuan, prompting concerns that the economy of the world´s largest energy consumer could be in worse shape than<br/>believed.In the United States, concerns over mounting oil stock levels persisted, with crude inventories likely to have risen by 439,000 barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll of eight analysts.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) will publish its closely watched weekly data at 1530 GMT.Some analysts think oil prices have fallen too far and will stage a sharp recovery later in the year, with Commerzbank targeting $60 per barrel by the end of 2016.""This looks ambitious from current levels but current prices are unsustainably low,"" Carsten Fritsch, senior oil analyst at Commerzbank, told the Global Oil Forum.""We are in a speculative exaggeration at the moment.""He added that he expects US oil production to fall at least 1 million bpd by autumn.  
ewarticle London: Global oil prices fell Monday, after bumper gains before the weekend, as many traders took profits and eyed plentiful world crude supplies, analysts said. European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery dropped $1.26 to $61.32 a barrel in London early afternoon deals.New York´s West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April shed 90 cents to $48.86 a barrel.Crude futures had rebounded sharply Friday at the end of a volatile trading week. WTI had advanced $1.59 while Brent gained a hefty $2.53.""Oil prices came under renewed pressure,"" said Sucden analyst Myrto Sokou on Monday.""Crude oil inventories continue to remain at fairly high levels following ongoing builds of crude stocks last week.""Oil has lost about 50 percent of its value since June, largely due to a global supply glut partially caused by surging US shale production.""Although there is still a global supply glut, oil prices are on a general increasing trend especially with the falling rig count numbers indicating that US shale is responding to low prices,"" Ken Hasegawa, energy trading manager at Newedge Group in Tokyo, told AFP. The weekly Baker Hughes US drilling rig count showed the number of rigs in operation fell by 33 to 986 in the week to February 27. The count is down 39 percent since October, according to Bloomberg News. Analysts said dealers will next be scrutinising a slew of US economic data to be released later Monday for clues on demand prospects in the world´s biggest crude consumer.

ewarticle ISLAMABAD: A two member committee tasked to probe the prevailing petrol shortage on Tuesday said that the situation was a serious failure on the part of OGRA (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority) as a regulator. The committee presented its initial findings to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a meeting held here under his chairmanship to review the petroleum situation in the country.The PM directed to make structural changes to ensure that such a situation never arises again. The meeting endorsed the earlier decision of suspending four senior officials responsible for the crisis.The meeting also decided that Deputy Managing Director Pakistan State Oil (PSO) Sohail Butt was also equally responsible and ordered for his suspension as well.Meanwhile, Petroleum Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said that he was never satisfied with the performance of OGRA and the authoritys performance as a regulator was not just dismal for petrol but was also same for gas.Petrol crisis: Day 8 The petrol crisis has entered its eight day in Punjab as commuters continue their search for fuel.

"
upcoming ECB policy meeting and quantitative easing impact on the euro,"LONDON: The US dollar hit multi-year highs against the euro and yen on Tuesday on the growing chance of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by mid-year, the prospect of which also hurt stocks and currencies from emerging markets.The skittish mood spread from Asia to Europe where stocks were down for a second day despite the European Central Bank's new bond buying campaign continuing to push down the euro and the bloc's already record-low borrowing costs.Driving the dollar up was speculation that the Federal Reserve, in contrast, will start lifting interest rates from mid-year after another round of stellar jobs data on Friday and a subsequent chorus of hawkish Fed policymaker comments.The euro's woes were compounded by worries about Greece as euro zone finance ministers met in Brussels a day after the head of the group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, urged Athens to ""stop wasting time"" and start implementing reforms.Selling in the euro had gathered pace again in Europe as a break below a major layer of chart support at $1.0762 to $1.0735 left bears eyeing 1.07 the figure and some mulling potential parity.The dollar also broke higher on the yen in Asia to reach 122.02, territory not visited since July 2007.""It is all about the Fed now,"" said Aurelija Augulyte senior FX strategist at Nordea in Helsinki. ""The ECB (bond buying) bias has now been fully digested, but what the market is now trying to do is price in earlier Fed rate hikes.""The prospect of rising US yields threatened to draw funds away from emerging markets, causing strains from Brazil to Turkey. The Brazilian real led the rout, having fallen for the sixth straight session.The pressure spread then through Asia with the South Korean won hitting its lowest since late August 2013 and the Singapore dollar its lowest since 2010.Eastern Europe was also heavily in the red. Selling accelerated for Poland's zloty, Romania's leu and Hungary's forint and MSCI's main emerging market stock index fell 1 percent, down for its eighth day running.                        










 
ewarticle NEW YORK: The euro surged against the dollar Friday amid hope that European leaders would accept Greece´s proposals for a new bailout deal over the weekend.The proposal, in which Athens offered signficant reforms over the next three years in exchange for fresh money and restructured debts from the country´s official EU creditors, raised optimism that another default by Greece and its exit from the euro area could be avoided.The euro rose more than one cent to $1.1149 around 2100 GMT on Friday. It also surged nearly three yen to 136.86 yen.""The current proposals set forth by Greece and the creditors should have enough common ground that an agreement can be reached before the negotiation deadline on Sunday,"" said Christopher Vecchio, an analyst at DailyFX.The greenback showed little effect from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen´s reiteration that the Fed´s first rate hike since 2006 will likely come before the end of the year.Yellen though remained cautious -- reflecting sentiment from the last Fed policy meeting -- noting continuing signs of slack in the jobs market and the risk of moving too soon on rates.""We will be watching carefully to see if there is continued improvement in labor market conditions, and we will need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to two percent in the next few years,"" she said.

ewarticle London: World stock markets churned lower Friday on lingering disappointment over ""underwhelming"" eurozone stimulus measures and ahead of key US jobs data.Equities had plunged Thursday as the European Central Bank´s latest stimulus plan disappointed investors, sparking a global sell off that spilled over into Wall Street and Asia.In late Friday morning deals, London lost another 0.2 percent, Frankfurt fell 0.6 percent and Paris also slid 0.6 percent, one day after the key indices shed between two and four percent in value.Speculation had swirled for weeks that the ECB would ramp up its bond-buying programme and loosen monetary policy to bolster growth and counter weak inflation.Hopes were stoked Wednesday by news that eurozone inflation languished at 0.1 percent in November -- far lower than the ECB´s official 2.0-percent target.The bank on Thursday cut deposit rates further into negative territory -- meaning lenders must pay to park cash with it and so look to loan more -- and extended the length of its bond purchases.- Huge let-down -However, the long-awaited announcement was seen as a huge let-down as it crucially failed to increase the size of the stimulus while the rate cut was less than hoped for.""Equity markets took a notable shake out yesterday in response to the underwhelming actions of the ECB,"" said TrustNet Direct analyst Tony Cross.""The central bank´s stimulus measures fell some way short of expectations, initiating degree of panic across the board.""This rattled US markets after the European close last night and is once again taking a toll in early trade as the week´s final session gets underway.""The news sent the euro surging on Thursday to a one-month peak at $1.0981, having earlier hit a 7.5-month low of $1.0524 in highly volatile deals.""Draghi failed to deliver on investors´ expectations,"" said ETX Capital analyst Daniel Sugarman.""In November the ECB governor had stated that the ECB would ´do what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible´ -- which investors took to mean the unveiling of a significant surge in monetary stimulus in December.""The single currency had come under fierce selling pressure leading up to the announcement as dealers positioned themselves for more far-reaching measures.- Fed caution -The euro´s gains were also given support after Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen said the bank remained wary of a US interest rate rise because of concerns about a strong dollar and other central banks´ loose monetary policies.While the Fed is still widely expected to lift rates this month -- for the first time in nine years -- Yellen´s comments caused traders to baulk after a recent run-up in the dollar. Dealers are now awaiting the release of key US jobs data later in the day, although analysts say the report would need to be monstrously bad to prevent a Fed rate rise in December.Asian stocks finished in the red, with Tokyo down 2.2 percent, Shanghai shedding 1.7 percent and Sydney 1.5 percent lower.Oil prices rose Friday amid OPEC´s policy meeting in Vienna, where the cartel appears on course to maintain crude production levels despite a recent plunge to underneath $40 per barrel.- Key figures around 1130 GMT -London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.2 percent at 6,263 pointsFrankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 0.6 percent at 10,728Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.6 percent at 4,702 EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.4 percent at 3,149Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 2.2 percent at 19,504.48 (close)New York - Dow: DOWN 1.4 percent at 17,477.67 (close)Euro/dollar: DOWN to $1.0876 from $1.0947 in late US trade on ThursdayDollar/yen: UP to 122.80 yen from 122.61 yen

ewarticle KARACHI: Governor Sindh Dr. Ishrat-ul-Ebad Khan has said exporters of various goods have played a vital role in economy of Pakistan and due to their efforts valuable addition is witnessed in national exchequer every year.This he said while talking to a 9-members delegation of Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (REAP) at Governor House here on Monday.Principal Secretary to Governor Muhammad Hussain Syed was also present on the occasion.Dr. Ebad said that agriculture was the back-bone of Pakistans economy as majority population is engaged with this sector.Cotton, rice, sugarcane, mango, citrus fruits and other crops have a pivotal contribution in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country as they employ millions of people, he observed.Governor Sindh said that rice is an important part of exports of Pakistan and basmati rice of Pakistan is renowned for its quality and taste worldwide.<br/> It also counts for sizeable amount of foreign exchange, he opined.On pointing of dormant state of Rice Research Institute (RRI), Dokri district, Larkana, Governor Sindh assured that all concerned would be called soon to know the reasons behind its ineffectiveness.The RRI has a very important role in producing new varieties of rice which are not only cost effective but also have visible consumption due to their quality, he added.On complaint of harassment from market committees, Governor Sindh asked Principal Secretary to examine the matter and resolve the same in consultation of all stake holders.He said that after improvement of law and order situation in Karachi, business community was engaged in their economic activities without any fear.Exporters would be provided all possible help and assistance to continue their exports, he assured.Governor Sindh commended the idea of holding a Biryani Festival and said that it would help in increasing rice exports.The Chief Patron of  REAP Abdul Rahim Janoo informed Governor Sindh that the Association has 1600 members from which 850 belong to Sindh.Pakistani rice is exported to 117 countries of the world including China, he said and added that Punjab produces Basmati while Sindh has Irri rice in abundance.He lauded the efforts of Governor Sindh in maintaining law &amp; order in Sindh and providing every possible facilities to business community.The delegation members included Senior Vice Chairman REAP Nauman Ahmed Shaikh, members managing Committee Javed Jilani, Inder Lal, Hamid Qureshi, Latif Paracha, Wajid Paracha, Rauf Aziz and Secretary Altaf Hussain.  
ewarticle strong>MUMBAI/KARACHI: Rising hostilities between India and Pakistan have brought their $822 million-a-year trade in cotton to a juddering halt, as traders who are worried about uncertainty over supplies and driven by patriotism hold off signing new deals.</strongThe nuclear-armed rivals have seen tensions ratchet up in the past few months over the disputed territory of Kashmir, and cotton traders in both countries said they were watching developments along the de facto border with alarm.Pakistan, the world's third-largest cotton consumer, usually starts importing from September, but three Indian exporters said the number of inquiries had slowed to a trickle in the last two weeks.In the clearest sign yet of souring relations affecting commerce, Pakistan-based importers also said they were not buying.""At the moment there is no cotton trade. It's at standstill. There is uncertainty that, God forbid, if war breaks out, what will happen?"" said Ihsanul Haq, chairman of the Pakistan Cotton Dealers Association.Pakistan Cotton Commissioner Khalid Abdullah said a ""low quantum of trade activity is still taking place.""He said the Pakistan government had not directed traders to stop buying Indian cotton and expected trade to normalize when tensions eased.Indian government officials said they had not yet noticed trading had stopped.But some Indian officials said last week that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government was considering whether it should choke trade with Pakistan to put pressure on its neighbour, even though the trade balance is in India's favour.strong>INDIA'S BIGGEST COTTON BUYER</strongTrade between India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars since their independence from British rule in 1947, is small.In the 2015/16 fiscal year ending on March 31, official trade between the two was $2.6 billion. Cotton is the largest component of that total.It is not clear whether other goods and commodities traded between the two, such as jewellery and dry fruits, have been hit by the escalation in hostilities as well, but the disruption to cotton shipments is potentially significant.In the crop year ended Sept. 30, Pakistan was India's biggest cotton buyer after its own crop was hit by drought and whitefly pest.It imported 2.5 million bales from India, and supported Indian cotton prices at a time when China was cutting imports, traders said.Lower purchases by Pakistan this year could hurt exports from the world's biggest producer of the fibre and put pressure on Indian prices, but could also help rival cotton suppliers like Brazil, the United States and some African countries.Chirag Patel, chief executive officer of Indian exporter Jaydeep Cotton Fibers, said the country could export 5 million bales in the 2016/17 crop year, but exports could plunge to 3 million bales without Pakistani imports.An exporter based in Mumbai estimated that Pakistan will need to import at least 3 million bales in 2016/17, and India will have a surplus of around 8 million bales.""As soon as the (political) situation improves, cotton trade will definitely resume between the two countries,"" said Haq of the Pakistan Cotton Dealers Association.But for now, traders on both sides of the border said the environment was not conducive to doing business.""Many cotton exporters are not interested in selling cotton to Pakistan. They are trying to find other markets,"" said Pradeep Jain, a ginner based in Jalgaon in the western state of Maharashtra.Shahzad Ali Khan, chairman of Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association, referred to a move by the Indian Motion Picture Producers' Association (IMPPA), a small filmmakers' body, last week, banning their members from hiring Pakistani actors.""India is banning Pakistani artists, so how can it expect us to buy cotton from India?"" Khan said.""In various forums Pakistani traders are saying they will not buy cotton from India this year. Even if they need to pay extra, they will pay and buy it from other suppliers.""

What are the implications of King Salman's succession on Saudi Arabia's oil policy?,"SINGAPORE: Saudi Arabia's new king is expected to continue a policy of keeping oil output steady to drive out rival producers, though the royal succession has focused market attention on the future of the kingdom's long-serving oil minister.King Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court in the world's top oil exporter said in a statement.Salman named his half-brother Muqrin as heir, rapidly moving to forestall any succession crisis at a moment when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders.While the new king is not seen as likely to change Abdullah's policies of keeping output high to protect the OPEC cartel's market share, some analysts said the succession has focused attention on the future of the oil minister Ali Al-Naimi.""King Abdullah was the architect of the current strategy to keep production high and force out smaller players instead of cutting,"" said John Kilduff, partner, Again Capital LLC in New York, adding that he expected Salman to keep production high.FGE analyst Tushar Bansal said: ""By and large, as of now, no major change is expected in Saudi policies"" but he said the market would focus on whether the oil minister might step down.""Ali Al-Naimi has been the oil minister since 1995... It was reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him to stay on for as long as he is around. So, the real question is, if there is a new oil minister soon, will it lead to a change in Saudi energy policy?""IHS oil consultant Victor Shum said speculation over the fate of the oil minister could add to market uncertainty though he did not expect a change of minister or in overall policy.""The decision on Saudi Arabia to keep pumping (oil) was made regardless of who the king may be,"" said Shum.Saudi leaders were also unlikely to want to repeat some previous policy misfires.In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its own output to prop up prices in the face of falling demand and rising supplies from non-OPEC suppliers but was dealt a double blow from lower prices and reduced output.Saudi policymakers would be determined not to make the same mistake again, analysts said.Crude oil futures jumped on Friday after news of the Saudi king's death but later came off their highs and were still trading at levels more than 50 percent below their most recent peaks in June, 2014. [O/R]""This little spike in prices is understandable... It should be sold off quickly and it won't last long at all,"" said Mark Keenan, an analyst at Societe Generale.                        










 
ewarticle ABU DHABI/KHOBAR: Saudi Arabia´s new energy minister said on Sunday the world´s largest crude exporter was committed to meeting demand for hydrocarbons from its customers and would maintain its petroleum policies.""Saudi Arabia will maintain its stable petroleum policies. We remain committed to maintaining our role in international energy markets and strengthening our position as the world´s most reliable supplier of energy,"" Khalid al-Falih said in an e-mailed statement.""We are committed to meeting existing and additional hydrocarbons demand from our expanding global customer base, backed by our current maximum sustainable capacity.""Since 2014, Saudi Arabia has led OPEC through a new survival-of-the-fittest strategy aimed at defending market share rather than reducing production to support oil prices.Falih´s comments on Sunday support analysts´ views that no shift in Saudi oil policy is likely as a result of his appointment.Falih´s appointment was part of a bigger Saudi shake-up announced on Saturday as King Salman restructered some big ministries in a major reshuffle intended to support a wide-ranging economic reform programme.As part of the restructuring, the Petroleum Ministry has been renamed the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources.""The creation of a new Ministry in Saudi Arabia that brings together the Kingdom´s abundant and unrivalled energy and mineral resources and industrial capabilities is in line with the ambitious objectives of Saudi Vision 2030,"" Falih said.  
ewarticle strong>RIYADH: Saudi Arabia's National Transformation Plan, a pivotal element of the ""Vision 2030"" reforms announced in April by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, will be put before the cabinet for approval on Monday, a senior Saudi source told Reuters.</strongThe plan is expected to flesh out sector-by-sector details of the implementation of Prince Mohammed's programme, which is intended to restructure the kingdom's entire economy and make it less dependent on oil revenue.""The Council of Economic and Development Affairs has approved the final draft of the National Transformation Plan, which is one of the plans adopted and part of the 2030 vision, which was launched and adopted by the Saudi deputy crown prince, president of CEDA,"" the source said.Prince Mohammed was given a central role in decision making after his father, King Salman, became monarch early last year, taking charge of CEDA, a new supercommittee of top ministers charged with overseeing reforms.Saudi Arabia finances now depend on oil revenue and its economic performance closely tracks government spending. But energy prices have plummeted since mid-2014, causing steep declines in income and putting growth at risk.HIGH PROFILEThe wider reforms are expected to include subsidy cuts, tax rises, sales of state assets, a government efficiency drive and efforts to spur private sector investment. Last month the International Monetary Fund said the plans were ""appropriately bold and far reaching"".Details of the plan, a programme of wide-ranging economic reforms, will be disclosed in daily news conferences with government ministers starting Monday evening, the senior source said.Other parts of the Vision 2030, including a partial privatisation of state oil giant Saudi Aramco and transformation of the government's Public Investment Fund into one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, have yet to be approved.The emphasis placed on the plan by Prince Mohammed is evident in the high-profile nature of its launch, with senior ministers expected to deliver rare briefings on how their departments will implement the programme.The timing is also significant because Monday is the first day of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, when business and government activity in the conservative Islamic kingdom have historically slowed down. Launching the plan despite the start of the holiday signals a more energetic approach.Riyadh has been cutting spending and trying to raise fresh revenues as it grapples with its budget deficit, which totalled $98 billion in 2015.The IMF predicted the deficit would stay very large this year, at about 14 percent of gross domestic product compared to 16 percent last year.

Impact of fuel shortages on Pakistan's economy and credit rating,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ongoing fuel shortage that has led to worsening power blackouts is weighing on its credit worthiness and hindering its ability to meet key reform targets laid out by the IMF, ratings agency Moody´s warned Monday. The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody´s said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt ""will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit negative"". ""Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.""The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody´s, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from ""negative"" to ""stable"" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a ""key driver"" in its decision last year. ""Circular debt"" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country´s oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moody´s warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. ""The government´s targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,"" it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total imports would further weigh on Pakistan´s import bill, it added.

He added it was possible to be done even sooner but it would depend on other factors, such as global oil prices.Sharif's government has made reducing energy shortages a top priority, embarking on construction of new dams, coal-fire power plants and renewable energy projects.Energy Minister Khawaja Asif said the South Asian nation had last week hit record production generation of 17,350 megawatts (MW), though production shortfalls varied between 1,500MW and 4,700MW through the week."

Euro gains against dollar after Greek election,"Hong Kong: The euro extended its gains against the dollar Tuesday while Asian equities climbed on hopes Greece´s new government will be able to negotiate a bailout deal with the EU and IMF that will avoid it leaving the eurozone.Regional investors took their lead from advances in Europe and New York, where news of Sunday´s Greek election win for anti-austerity party Syriza had been largely factored in, analysts said.Tokyo jumped 1.44 percent by lunch, Sydney added 0.67 percent, Shanghai edged up 0.10 percent, Seoul rose 0.46 percent and Hong Kong was flat.Markets have been buoyed by rhetoric coming out of Athens and its creditors that raises hopes they two sides can reach an agreement over Greece´s repayment of its 240-billion-euro bailout.Syriza had campaigned on renegotiating terms of the lifeline -- which included swingeing spending cuts and painful tax hikes -- and there are concerns it will default on its repayments, leading to its possible exit from the eurozone.But International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said she was prepared to continue its financial support to the country, while some European finance ministers suggested they were willing to talk, as long as Syriza did not demand its debt be wiped out.The messages coming out of Europe helped shares higher. In Europe, equities in London, Paris and Germany all closed with healthy gains, although Athens lost more than three percent.Dow edged 0.03 percent higher, the S&P 500 added 0.26 percent and the Nasdaq put on 0.29 percent.""The Greek elections had the potential to unnerve the market,"" Nader Naeimi, at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.""It´s quite encouraging that the new government and the EU are willing to negotiate. The market is in a risk-on mode.""The euro plunged to as low as $1.1098 at one point in Asia Monday, the lowest level since September 2003, before recovering later in the day to close out in New York at $1.1234.On Tuesday in Asia it bought $1.1250.It also sank to 131.55 yen Monday in Asia before bouncing to end the day at 133.12 yen. It bought 133.31 yen in Tokyo Tuesday.The dollar edged up to 118.47 yen from 118.49 yen in US trade.Oil prices edged up slightly after falling to fresh six-year lows Monday, despite a warning from the OPEC cartel that prices could punch $200 owing to shrinking investment in exploration.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for March delivery rose five cents to $45.20 while Brent crude for March gained 13 cents to $48.29.Gold fetched $1,276.39 an ounce, against $1,281.39 late Monday.

ewarticle Hong Kong: Asian markets followed a positive lead from Wall Street on Tuesday, with investors keeping an eye on Europe as Greece struggles to pay off its debts.Tokyo rose 0.79 percent, Hong Kong added 1.14 percent, Sydney gained 0.93 percent and Shanghai was up 0.72 percent, while Seoul was flat.The gains reversed some of the losses suffered on Monday that came on fears about Greece´s future in the eurozone as Athens looks to secure billions of euros in bailout cash to pay its enormous debts.With its creditors refusing to extend a repayment deadline while also haggling over its bailout reforms, the Greek government has ordered all public agencies to hand over their financial reserves.""With this act, the government hopes to cover urgent needs of the state amounting to three billion euros for the next 15 days,"" said a decree, which still needs adoption by the parliament.However, the euro held its ground in foreign exchange markets. The single currency bought $1.0733 and 128.20 yen against $1.0741 and 128.05 yen on Wall Street.Hong Kong and Shanghai resumed their upward trend after sharp losses Monday that came after China´s stock market regulator tightened rules on trading with borrowed money and increase the supply of shares for short-selling.Confidence was buoyed by Sunday´s cut by the People´s Bank of China in the amount of cash lenders must hold in reserve, the move aimed at helping kick-start the economy, which grew in January-March at its slowest quarterly pace in six years. The next indicator on the state of China´s economy comes with HSBC´s preliminary index of manufacturing activity on Thursday.US traders welcomed that move. The Dow jumped 1.17 percent, the S&P 500 rose 0.92 percent and the Nasdaq rallied 1.27 percent.The dollar edged up despite a key Federal Reserve official suggesting a US rate hike could be put back.New York Fed President William C. Dudley said recent inflation data was not strong enough to warrant an increase, even though economics growth was healthy.The dollar was at 119.34 yen against 119.22 yen, and sharply higher than 118.62 yen in Tokyo earlier Monday.Oil prices retreated. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for May delivery fell 15 cents to $56.23 while Brent crude for June dipped 15 cents to $63.30.Gold fetched $1,194.55 against $1,200.30 late Monday.

ewarticle NEW YORK: The euro gained ground on Wednesday on hopes that Greece´s debt crisis will be resolved in a few days, averting a default to its European Union creditors.The euro, which had fallen to a five-week low of $1.0916 on Tuesday, rebounded as Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras vowed to present ""credible"" reform plans to creditors by Thursday.The 19-nation currency rose to $1.1074 around 2100 GMT from $1.1007 at the same time Tuesday.European Union President Donald Tusk has set the ""final deadline"" for a deal on Sunday at a summit of all 28 EU leaders.""Between the unusual suspension of trading on the NYSE and the meltdown in Asian equities, investors sent the euro higher on signs of progress towards a deal for Greece,"" said Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management.The New York Stock Exchange halted trading Wednesday for more than three hours due to technical problems that it said were not caused by hacking.Meanwhile, a weeks-long rout in Chinese equities continued, with stocks losing more than 30 percent since mid-June.The Federal Reserve´s release of the minutes of the June 16-17 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee showed policymakers favored caution about embarking on the first interest rate hike in nine years.Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, said the Fed minutes were less important to markets than normal because of the heightened level of concern regarding Greece and China.""On both fronts, underlying conditions have deteriorated markedly since the Fed´s mid-June meeting, so the minutes may be largely irrelevant at this point,"" he said.                        










 
ewarticle NEW YORK: The euro surged against the dollar Friday amid hope that European leaders would accept Greece´s proposals for a new bailout deal over the weekend.The proposal, in which Athens offered signficant reforms over the next three years in exchange for fresh money and restructured debts from the country´s official EU creditors, raised optimism that another default by Greece and its exit from the euro area could be avoided.The euro rose more than one cent to $1.1149 around 2100 GMT on Friday. It also surged nearly three yen to 136.86 yen.""The current proposals set forth by Greece and the creditors should have enough common ground that an agreement can be reached before the negotiation deadline on Sunday,"" said Christopher Vecchio, an analyst at DailyFX.The greenback showed little effect from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen´s reiteration that the Fed´s first rate hike since 2006 will likely come before the end of the year.Yellen though remained cautious -- reflecting sentiment from the last Fed policy meeting -- noting continuing signs of slack in the jobs market and the risk of moving too soon on rates.""We will be watching carefully to see if there is continued improvement in labor market conditions, and we will need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to two percent in the next few years,"" she said.                        










 
ewarticle LONDON: The US dollar hit multi-year highs against the euro and yen on Tuesday on the growing chance of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by mid-year, the prospect of which also hurt stocks and currencies from emerging markets.The skittish mood spread from Asia to Europe where stocks were down for a second day despite the European Central Bank's new bond buying campaign continuing to push down the euro and the bloc's already record-low borrowing costs.Driving the dollar up was speculation that the Federal Reserve, in contrast, will start lifting interest rates from mid-year after another round of stellar jobs data on Friday and a subsequent chorus of hawkish Fed policymaker comments.The euro's woes were compounded by worries about Greece as euro zone finance ministers met in Brussels a day after the head of the group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, urged Athens to ""stop wasting time"" and start implementing reforms.Selling in the euro had gathered pace again in Europe as a break below a major layer of chart support at $1.0762 to $1.0735 left bears eyeing 1.07 the figure and some mulling potential parity.The dollar also broke higher on the yen in Asia to reach 122.02, territory not visited since July 2007.""It is all about the Fed now,"" said Aurelija Augulyte senior FX strategist at Nordea in Helsinki. ""The ECB (bond buying) bias has now been fully digested, but what the market is now trying to do is price in earlier Fed rate hikes.""The prospect of rising US yields threatened to draw funds away from emerging markets, causing strains from Brazil to Turkey. The Brazilian real led the rout, having fallen for the sixth straight session.The pressure spread then through Asia with the South Korean won hitting its lowest since late August 2013 and the Singapore dollar its lowest since 2010.Eastern Europe was also heavily in the red. Selling accelerated for Poland's zloty, Romania's leu and Hungary's forint and MSCI's main emerging market stock index fell 1 percent, down for its eighth day running.                        










"
Current trends in oil prices and factors affecting them,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices remained near 2016 highs in early trading on Thursday, buoyed by a fall in U.S. crude inventories, a weaker dollar and strong demand, but some analysts warned that the recent rally was starting to look overblown.</strongInternational Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were trading at $52.70 per barrel at 0045 GMT, up 19 cents from their last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was 32 cents higher at $51.55 a barrel.Traders said the price rises were largely a result of a drop in U.S. crude oil inventories.Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. crude stocks last week fell by 3.23 million barrels to 532.5 million barrels, marking their third consecutive weekly fall.A weaker dollar, down around 2.4 percent this month against a basket of other currencies, makes dollar-traded fuel imports for countries using other currencies cheaper, also supporting oil prices, traders said.But some analysts said there were also signs that the recent oil price rise, which saw Brent rally 6 percent this month and prices virtually double since February to one-year highs, may be overblown.ANZ bank said that price rises were ""tempered by an increase in crude production of 10,000 barrels per day to 8.75 million barrels per day and the number of active rigs increasing by 9 to 325"".Traders also warned of an ongoing build in refined product stocks in the United States and Asia.With fundamentals weighing both for and against higher prices, many traders and analysts say that a price tag of $50-60 for a barrel of crude was a fair value for oil, reflected in Brent's forward curve which stays within that range until early 2021. 
ewarticle KARACHI: The price of petroleum products are expected to increase in June, industry sources have revealed to Geo News. The per litre price of diesel may rise by Rs6.20 and petrol by Rs5.80.  A staggering Rs11 increase may be seen in the price of HOBC. The reason for the price increase is the turmoil in Yemen which has led to an increase in crude oil price in the international market.  










 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices dipped in early Asian trade on Monday as rising production in the Middle East outweighed falling US output and the recent slide in the dollar, which has been supporting crude.</strongBrent futures were trading at $47.05 (32 pounds) per barrel at 0028 GMT on Monday, down 32 cents from their last settlement. US crude was down 28 cents at $45.64 a barrel.Analysts said rising output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and especially the Middle East was outweighing supportive factors such as an ongoing, albeit slow, fall in U.S. output and a sliding dollar, which makes it cheaper for countries using other currencies to import dollar-traded fuel.""The weaker dollar failed to excite investors in the crude oil markets,"" ANZ bank said, citing a rise in OPEC-output as the main downward driver for prices.The dollar has fallen over 6 percent this year against a basket of other leading currencies.French bank BNP Paribas said that a recent oil rally, with prices jumping almost a third since April, was largely driven by sentiment and lacked physical fundamentals.""The recent rally in oil prices ... appears to have little to do with fundamentals,"" it said.""We see the recent rally as sowing the seeds of its own demise, and extending our recommendation to protect against short-term downside risk.""OPEC-supplies rose to 32.64 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, from 32.47 million bpd in March, according to a Reuters survey based on shipping data and information from sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.That almost matches January's 32.65 million bpd, when Indonesia's return to OPEC boosted production to records.Despite Monday's lower prices, other analysts are growing confident that a near-two-year rout in oil has ended, and many have raised their price forecasts.The chief of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil prices may have bottomed out, providing the health of the global economy does not pose a concern.""In a normal economic environment, we will see the price direction is rather upwards than downwards,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Sunday.Non-OPEC output is set to fall by more than 700,000 bpd this year, the biggest decline in around 20 years, he said.With global oil demand seen growing by 1.2 million bpd this year, the draw in global stockpiles will start soon, helping push up prices, he said. 
ewarticle London: Oil prices nudged higher on Friday, further recovering from a steep dive seen mid-week, although demand is set to remain shackled by a global supply glut, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in May edged up one cent to $50.80 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for May gained 27 cents to $56.84 around midday in London.WTI and Brent sank 3.6 percent on Wednesday after the US Department of Energy said commercial inventories in the world´s biggest economy hit a record high last week.That came after Saudi Arabia´s Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said his country´s production had hit an all-time high of 10.3 million barrels a day in March.Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group, has said this week that rising imports of US crude oil could indicate improved demand prospects in the world´s largest oil consumer or concerns about supply tightening.Price support has meanwhile come from events concerning major oil producer Iran.Analysts attributed steep gains at the start of the week to investors concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.The United States on Thursday warned that sanctions on Iran will be lifted in stages as a nuclear deal is implemented, after Tehran demanded they be removed as soon as it comes into force.""Geopolitical factors remain a constant worry for investors with concerns regarding Iran´s nuclear programme potentially leading to ongoing volatility in the crude oil market,"" said Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokerage.

"
How are Islamic banks in Pakistan addressing profitability and customer rewards?,"KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor on Thursday urged the country´s Islamic banks to develop ways to reward their customers in line with a surge in the sector´s profitability, or face regulatory action. Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industry´s share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be ""reasonably rationalised"", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits.""Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue,"" said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lion´s share of financing by the country´s Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent. Murabaha is often criticised for lacking economic substance and its resemblance to a conventional loan. 










 
ewarticle KARACHI: Finance Minister, Ishaq Dar on Wednesday said those who used to call Pakistan bankrupt have been shut down for good and vowed to transform the country into worlds 18th best performing economy.Pakistans budget deficit will be further curtailed in the coming three years, he expressed the resolve while addressing the launching ceremony of Islamic Index here at Karachi Stock Exchange.Earlier, the Finance Minister rang the conventional bell and let the trade begin.Expressing his contentment over the performance of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), he identified Islamic banking as a challenge and added that the government was working towards its promotion as well as serving the country at large.Terming the introduction of the Islamic Index as a milestone, Ishaq Dar said the new index will cast a positive impact on the stock exchange.He said investment in Islamic banking will yield positive results for the stock market of the country.Later, talking to media men, Ishaq Dar said the government will extend its all out cooperation to the traders and encourage them to invest in Islamic banking.He said the economic indicators have shown positive growth while the countrys foreign exchange reserves have witnessed a record leap. 










 
ewarticle LAHORE: Federal Finance Minister, Ishaq Dar on Saturday claimed that Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) has once again put the failed state back on its feet. We are taking Pakistan to an economic take off, he said while addressing a national conference organized by Jang Group of Companies on the topic of Role of Islamic Banking in Pakistan Economy. He said the promotion of Islamic banking in Pakistan is among the top priorities of the government. Instructions have already been issued to the institutions to carry out transactions through Islamic banking, he added. Governor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Ashraf Wathra, president National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) Ashraf Iqbal and president Muslim Commercial Bank (MCB), Mian Mansha said there is a great scope for Islamic banking in agriculture, SMEs and housing sectors. MD Jang Group, Sarmad Ali, Deputy Governor SBP Saeed Ahmed, president Meezan Bank Irfan Siddiqui, president SAARC Chamber Iftikhar Ali Malik and president Al-Barka Bank Shafaat Ahmed also spoke on the occasion. 
ewarticle strong>KARACHI: Meeting of the Board of Directors (BoD) of National Bank of Pakistan (bank) was held today (Thursday) at Banks Head Office in Karachi in which the BoD approved the financial statements of the bank for the nine months period ended September 30, 2016.</strongBanks after-tax profit for the nine months period increased by 11 percent to Rs. 13.4billion compared to Rs. 12.1 billion for the corresponding nine months of 2015. This translates into earnings per share of Rs.6.3 i.e. 11pc up against Rs. 5.7 for the comparative period last year.Pre-tax and after-tax return on equity were 26.4pc, and 15.5pc (September2015: 26.2pc and 14.5pc) respectively; whereas the pre-tax and after tax return on assets are 1.7pc and 1.0pc respectively.Despite a continued reduction in the discount rate during recent quarters, banks net interest income increased by 4.3pc YoY to Rs. 39.3 billion against Rs. 37.6 billion for nine months of 2015.Specific provision charge for the period was Rs. 1.9 billion, 76pc lower than Rs. 8.2 billion for the corresponding nine month period of 2015. This depicts an improvement in the assets quality of the bank. During the period, the bank earned a fee/commission income of Rs. 9.96 billion being 20.4pc up against Rs. 8.3 billion for the comparative nine months period of 2015. 
ewarticle LIMASSOL: Moodys Investors Service on Wednesday changed the outlook for the Pakistan banking system to stable from negative, reflecting the improvement in the countrys economic growth prospects, driven in turn by the governments commitment to economic reforms under its IMF program.We expect the strengthening economy, together with the central banks accommodative monetary policy, to stimulate lending growth and support the banking sectors loan performance over the next 12-18 months,"" said Elena Panayiotou, a Moodys Assistant Vice President and lead analyst for Pakistani banks.Moodys forecasts Pakistans real GDP will expand by 4.0 per cent in the fiscal year ending June 2016 (compared to a sluggish 2.8pc during 2008-13), mainly driven by higher spending on infrastructure projects as the government aims to ease energy shortages and execute projects associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The rating agency noted that the strengthening of the domestic economy will contribute to the improvement in Pakistani banks asset quality. The level of credit risk, however, will remain high as banks are heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign (B3, stable) through holdings of securities and government-related loans, which were equivalent in size to 7.3x Tier 1 capital, exposing banks to event risk.""We expect problem loans will decline to around 12 per cent of total loans by the end of 2016 compared with 12.4pc for the end of June 2015. Banks, however, will remain heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign, linking the banks creditworthiness to that of the sovereign"" Panayiotou said.In the area of capital, the rating agency expected that buffers will come under pressure due to moderate asset growth and lower internal capital generation  a result of weaker profitability.Moodys expected earnings to ease slightly over the outlook period, mainly because of the lower coupon on government securities in a declining interest rate environment and as the markets perception of Pakistans risk profile eases (upgraded to B3 from Caa1 on June 11, 2015). Higher loan volumes and capital gains booked through the sale of government securities will only partially offset the pressure on profitability.In addition, the rating agency expected that Pakistani banks will maintain ample liquidity and continue to benefit from large volumes of low-cost and stable customer deposits.""The Pakistani banks deposit-based funding structure remains a credit strength. We expect inflows of remittances from migrant workers will continue to drive the growth in bank deposits and support banks funding bases,"" said the asst vice-president of Moody's.While banks will use part of their liquid asset to fund lending, Moodys expected the sector to maintain strong liquidity buffers, with core liquid assets  defined as cash and bank placements  at 12 per cent of total assets and liquid securities, more broadly defined, at 41pc of total assets as of June 2015.

current trends in oil prices 2023,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices nudged higher on Wednesday on expectations of a U.S. crude inventory draw, although trading activity was muted as markets start to wind down ahead of the Christmas weekend.</strongU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures CLc1 were trading at $53.58 per barrel at 0105 GMT, up 28 cents from their last settlement.International Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were at $55.57 a barrel, up 22 cents.Traders said the higher prices were largely due to an expected reduction in U.S. crude oil inventories, which will be reported late on Wednesday.Jeffrey Halley, analyst at futures OANDA in Singapore said U.S. crude stocks were expected to fall by 2.563 million barrels.In the absence of strong fundamentals, traders said that technical support and resistance levels would become price drivers.""U.S. oil may rise to $54.37 per barrel, as it has broken resistance at $53.36,"" said Reuters technical commodities analyst Wang Tao.""Brent oil is poised to break a resistance at $55.79 per barrel,"" he said. 
ewarticle strong>LONDON: Oil edged above $50 a barrel on Thursday, drawing support from sources' comments that OPEC's Gulf members are willing to cut their output by 4 percent and from a further drop in U.S. crude inventories.</strongSaudi Arabia and its Gulf OPEC allies are willing to make that reduction from their peak oil output, energy ministers from the Gulf countries told their Russian counterpart this week, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.""That seems to be the reason behind the price move,"" said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank. ""But the big question is, how will they handle Iraq.""Brent crude was up 38 cents at $50.36 a barrel as of 1348 GMT, having risen as high as $50.67 intra-day. U.S. crude gained 28 cents to $49.46.Oil also drew support from the unexpected drop in U.S. crude inventories, and larger than expected falls in stocks of gasoline and distillates, reported this week, which raised hopes that a long-awaited market rebalancing is finally under way.""The global stock overhang must be reduced in order to see higher prices. Whilst such reduction is largely in the hand of OPEC, the re-balancing is already taking place in the U.S.,"" Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM said.The market was keeping an eye on escalating protests in Venezuela against the rule of President Nicolas Maduro, although there was no sign of any impact on the OPEC member's oil output. Venezuelan production has been falling this year as low prices hit investment.Doubts about the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' supply cut deal have been weighing on the market this week.OPEC agreed last month its first deal to restrain output in eight years to boost prices. But Iraq on Sunday called for Baghdad to be exempt, adding to the list of members seeking special treatment.A technical meeting at OPEC's headquarters on Friday, and with officials from non-OPEC countries on Saturday, is supposed to come up with recommendations on how to implement the supply cutback to the oil ministers' next meeting on Nov. 30.The OPEC plan is designed to speed up the removal of a supply glut that is keeping oil prices at less than half their level of mid-2014, cutting exporters' income and leading to investment cuts by oil companies worldwide. 
ewarticle London: World oil prices rose Wednesday on bargain-hunting after sharp falls the previous day triggered by a strong US dollar and global supply glut concerns, analysts said.In early afternoon London deals, Brent North Sea crude for July added 36 cents to $64.08 per barrel, compared with Tuesday´s closing level.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in July won 43 cents to $58.46 a barrel.Crude futures had shed more than $1.60 on Tuesday, as markets in the United States and much of Europe reopened after a public holiday on Monday.Oil prices have been under pressure on a resurgent dollar, which has strengthened following expectations that the US Federal Reserve will follow through on plans to raise record-low interest rates later this year.The stronger greenback makes crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.""As the prices for crude dropped quite sharply last night, the current rebound is due to bargain hunting as traders pounce at the low prices,"" Nicholas Teo, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, told AFP.Teo said dealers are also awaiting the latest official US stockpiles report for fresh clues about demand and production levels in the world´s top crude consumer.Crude reserves likely fell by 1.5 million barrels in the week to May 22, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.Overall US stockpiles, which stand at 482.2 million barrels, are at the highest level since 1930, according to data compiled by the US Energy Information Administration.The weekly report is normally published every Wednesday but will be issued this Thursday due to the US public holiday on Monday.Dealers have been hoping that a slowdown in US output, coupled with increased demand during the summer driving season, could whittle down the build up of global crude reserves, which was a key reason for the collapse in prices of more than 50 percent between June and January.(AFP) 










 
ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices remained under pressure in Asia Friday after a huge jump in US crude inventories reinforced projections that a supply glut will persist well into next year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in December was down 24 cents to $41.51 and Brent crude for December was trading four cents higher at $44.10 a barrel at around 0330 GMT.Prices were hammered Thursday after the US Department of Energy reported that commercial crude inventories in the world´s top oil consumer grew by 4.2 million barrels last week, far higher than analyst expectations of an increase of 1.3 million barrels.WTI sank 2.7 percent and Brent fell 3.8 percent after the report, which also showed US crude oil production continued to ramp higher.Global oil demand growth has not been fast enough to soak up the excess in supplies and analysts say a rebalancing of the supply-demand situation is needed for a sustained uptick in prices.Oil prices have plunged by more than half from peaks of over $100 a barrel in mid-2014.""Although global oil demand growth has been exceptionally strong year-to-date, the overall pace of supply side adjustment has been too slow to end a sustained increase in global inventories that we expect to persist through most of 2016,"" British bank Barclays said.It said in a market commentary that US offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico reached its highest level since early 2010 in August and is expected to remain strong although at a slower pace into 2016 ""as several more new fields begin to produce"".Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have also kept production high in an aggressive bid to retain market share.OPEC´s collective production has stabilised at around 31.5 million barrels per day in recent months, Barclays said, but this is still more than its output ceiling of 30 million barrels per day.

(it) could easily do it in the next trading session."""

US Justice Department investigation into Moody's mortgage ratings,"NEW YORK: US authorities are investigating the credit rating agency Moody's over its glowing assessments of mortgage deals in the runup to the 2008 financial crisis, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.Citing people familiar with the situation, the newspaper said Justice Department officials had met with several former Moody's executives. It wasn't yet clear if the probe would result in a lawsuit.If the investigation is confirmed, Moody's would become the second major US credit-rating firm in the Justice Department's crosshairs, after a case against Standard & Poor's.S&P is expected to within days agree to pay $1.37 billion to settle lawsuits over its rosy grading of mortgage bonds in the financial crisis, sources told AFP.Neither Moody's nor the Justice Department were immediately reachable for comment Sunday.US authorities are probing whether the firm compromised its standards to score deals, the Journal reported, and the focus is on residential mortgage deals from about 2004 to 2007.Positive ratings on what turned out to be extremely risky mortgage deals, known as subprime loans, were a main cause of the 2008 financial collapse.Investors rely on rating firms' grades to assess risk.Numerous banks have already paid huge fines and settlements for their roles in packaging and selling the bonds as low-risk, solid investments. 










 
ewarticle ISLAMABAD: Moody's Investor Service has upgraded Pakistans sovereign credit rating by a notch, from Caa1 to B3, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar announced on Thursday in the National Assembly.According to Dar, Moody's had downgraded the countrys credit rating to Caa1 on July 13, 2012.The outlook for the rating back then was negative. A sovereign with a Caa rating is judged to be of poor standing and subject to very high credit risk.Weak government finances, structural inflationary pressures and domestic political uncertainties were adding to Pakistan's external vulnerabilities and debt sustainability, thereby compounding the downward pressure on sovereign creditworthiness, Moodys said.Moody's also said the downgrade was also prompted by an upcoming repayment of $7.5 billion to the International Monetary Fund. 










 
ewarticle LIMASSOL: Moodys Investors Service on Wednesday changed the outlook for the Pakistan banking system to stable from negative, reflecting the improvement in the countrys economic growth prospects, driven in turn by the governments commitment to economic reforms under its IMF program.We expect the strengthening economy, together with the central banks accommodative monetary policy, to stimulate lending growth and support the banking sectors loan performance over the next 12-18 months,"" said Elena Panayiotou, a Moodys Assistant Vice President and lead analyst for Pakistani banks.Moodys forecasts Pakistans real GDP will expand by 4.0 per cent in the fiscal year ending June 2016 (compared to a sluggish 2.8pc during 2008-13), mainly driven by higher spending on infrastructure projects as the government aims to ease energy shortages and execute projects associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The rating agency noted that the strengthening of the domestic economy will contribute to the improvement in Pakistani banks asset quality. The level of credit risk, however, will remain high as banks are heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign (B3, stable) through holdings of securities and government-related loans, which were equivalent in size to 7.3x Tier 1 capital, exposing banks to event risk.""We expect problem loans will decline to around 12 per cent of total loans by the end of 2016 compared with 12.4pc for the end of June 2015. Banks, however, will remain heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign, linking the banks creditworthiness to that of the sovereign"" Panayiotou said.In the area of capital, the rating agency expected that buffers will come under pressure due to moderate asset growth and lower internal capital generation  a result of weaker profitability.Moodys expected earnings to ease slightly over the outlook period, mainly because of the lower coupon on government securities in a declining interest rate environment and as the markets perception of Pakistans risk profile eases (upgraded to B3 from Caa1 on June 11, 2015). Higher loan volumes and capital gains booked through the sale of government securities will only partially offset the pressure on profitability.In addition, the rating agency expected that Pakistani banks will maintain ample liquidity and continue to benefit from large volumes of low-cost and stable customer deposits.""The Pakistani banks deposit-based funding structure remains a credit strength. We expect inflows of remittances from migrant workers will continue to drive the growth in bank deposits and support banks funding bases,"" said the asst vice-president of Moody's.While banks will use part of their liquid asset to fund lending, Moodys expected the sector to maintain strong liquidity buffers, with core liquid assets  defined as cash and bank placements  at 12 per cent of total assets and liquid securities, more broadly defined, at 41pc of total assets as of June 2015.                        










 
ewarticle strong>WASHINGTON: US regulators fined Goldman Sachs $120 million Wednesday for attempting to manipulate a widely-used global interest rate benchmark to benefit its trading positions.</strongGoldman Sachs traders between 2007 and 2012 deliberately timed and priced trades to influence the published price of the benchmark interest rate, the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission said in a statement.Goldman, one of a group of banks whose data set the benchmark daily, also made false submissions to skew the rate at the expense of counterparties, the CFTC said.The US Dollar International Swaps and Derivates Association Fix is a daily benchmark used for a wide range of financial products, such as interest-rate swaps and derivatives.In addition, the company´s cooperation ""was not satisfactory"" prior to the latter stages of the investigation, the CFTC added.The agency previously fined Citigroup and Barclays for attempted manipulation of the same benchmark interest rate.""This matter, the third enforcement action relating to the (benchmark), demonstrates the breadth of this kind of misconduct across the industry, and within Goldman, the extent of the misconduct across trading desks and product lines,"" said CFTC director of enforcement Aitan Goelman.Besides paying the fine, Goldman´s supervisor for trading on interest-rate products must attest to the effectiveness of remedies to fix the problem.In a separate case,, the Swiss Competition Commission earlier Wednesday hit eight large global banks a total fine of nearly $100 million for rigging international rates between 2005 and 2010.

ewarticle strong>NEW YORK: Authorities in the US are seeking as much as $14 billion from Deutsche Bank to resolve allegations stemming from the sale of mortgage securities in the 2008 crisis, the German financial giant confirmed Thursday.</strongThe payout would be the largest ever inflicted on a foreign bank in the United States, easily surpassing the $8.9 billion that the French bank BNP Paribas paid in 2014 for sanctions violations.But in a quick reaction, Deutsche Bank rejected the $14 billion figure, which the bank said was an opening proposal in settlement talks with US prosecutors.""Deutsche Bank has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited,"" the statement said.""The negotiations are only just beginning. The bank expects that they will lead to an outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at materially lower amounts.""The US investment bank Goldman Sachs in April agreed to pay more than $5 billion to settle similar allegations.US authorities have accused major banks of misleading investors about the values and quality of complex mortgage-backed securities sold before the 2008 financial crisis.Much of the underlying lending was worthless or fraudulent, delivering billions of dollars in losses to holders of the mortgage bonds when the housing market collapsed, bringing down numerous banks and touching off the country´s worst recession since the 1930s.According to securities filings, Deutsche Bank as of June 30 had set aside $5.5 billion to resolve pending legal matters. In the mortgage-backed securities matter, the bank is aiming for an amount between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to knowledgeable sources.The US Justice Department declined to comment.Bank of America in 2014 paid out nearly $17 billion in a related enforcement action but federal authorities have faced stinging criticism for failing to hold individuals to account.In recent years, Deutsche Bank has found itself mired litigation and enforcement actions around the world.US market regulators last year fined the German lender $55 million, concluding that it had overvalued its holdings of credit derivatives by at least $15 billion during the financial crisis.In 2015 and 2016 Deutsche Bank failed so-called stress tests conducted by the US central bank that were designed to determine whether it had adequate capital strength to weather shocks such as those of the financial crisis.In June, the International Monetary Fund described the bank as a ""major systemic risk,"" leaving its chief executive John Cryan to strive to convince markets that Deutsche Bank was bound to recover.In April of last year, Deutsche Bank also paid a record $2.5 billion to settle American and British charges that it had manipulated the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, affecting commercial interest rates.The bank also settled with the US Fed and New York´s Department of Financial Services of alleged sanctions violations in Syria and Iran.In July Deutsche Bank posted a 98 percent year-on-year drop in second-quarter profits, with net earnings recorded at only $22 million, which Cryan, the bank´s chief, attributed to ""sustained restructuring.""Cryan plans to cut 9,000 jobs worldwide by 2020, while the bank´s share price has fallen to around 10 percent of its pre-crisis value."
Current trends in global oil prices and factors affecting them,"London: Oil prices nudged higher on Friday, further recovering from a steep dive seen mid-week, although demand is set to remain shackled by a global supply glut, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in May edged up one cent to $50.80 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for May gained 27 cents to $56.84 around midday in London.WTI and Brent sank 3.6 percent on Wednesday after the US Department of Energy said commercial inventories in the world´s biggest economy hit a record high last week.That came after Saudi Arabia´s Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said his country´s production had hit an all-time high of 10.3 million barrels a day in March.Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group, has said this week that rising imports of US crude oil could indicate improved demand prospects in the world´s largest oil consumer or concerns about supply tightening.Price support has meanwhile come from events concerning major oil producer Iran.Analysts attributed steep gains at the start of the week to investors concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.The United States on Thursday warned that sanctions on Iran will be lifted in stages as a nuclear deal is implemented, after Tehran demanded they be removed as soon as it comes into force.""Geopolitical factors remain a constant worry for investors with concerns regarding Iran´s nuclear programme potentially leading to ongoing volatility in the crude oil market,"" said Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokerage.

ewarticle London: Fragile financial markets are grappling with wild swings in world oil prices, unnerved by uncertainty over global supplies and the demand outlook from China.By the close of business Monday, the price had shot up 27 percent in just three days for the US benchmark contract, West Texas Intermediate for October delivery, rebounding from six and a half year lows.But they skidded again Tuesday when weak Chinese manufacturing data cemented concerns over demand from the world´s biggest commodities consumer.Later in the week oil prices got a boost from the European Central Bank, which on Thursday held out the prospect of yet more stimulus for the eurozone economies if needed.By the end of the week, crude oil prices were trading in London on Friday evening barely changed.Brent North Sea crude sold at $49.95 a barrel -- down from $50.17 a week earlier. The WTI contract traded at $46.22, up from $45.22.Crude oil, the world economy´s most important raw material, has roughly halved in price in a year.""The fall in commodity prices has looked particularly dramatic because it has included oil,"" said Julian Jessop, chief global economist and head of commodities at London-based research group Capital Economics.While many raw materials have been declining in price since 2011 as China´s booming economy began to slow, oil´s price had been propped up by a perceived threat to supply after the Arab Spring, Jessop said in an interview.""Once the concerns about the potential threat to supply from the Arab Spring disappeared and were replaced by the reality of massive oversupply because of the shale revolution in the United States and OPEC´s response of keeping production high when people had thought it might cut, then oil tanked,"" the analyst said.Keeping pressure on oil prices, Iraq has managed to boost production this year by 1.5 million barrels per day despite the conflict with extremists including Daesh group and Iran is set to raise exports as sanctions are lifted after an agreement was reached over its nuclear programme.Despite the uncertainty on commodity markets, the price of gold -- a safe haven -- lost its shine over the past week, hurt by a rally in the US dollar.The precious metal also lost its lure as a haven at as volatile Chinese markets took a holiday on Thursday and Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.On the London Bullion Market, gold was trading at $1,118.25 dollars an ounce Friday against $1.135 dollars a week before.

US crude was down 28 cents at $45.64 a barrel.Analysts said rising output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and especially the Middle East was outweighing supportive factors such as an ongoing, albeit slow, fall in U.S. output and a sliding dollar, which makes it cheaper for countries using other currencies to import dollar-traded fuel.""The weaker dollar failed to excite investors in the crude oil markets,"" ANZ bank said, citing a rise in OPEC-output as the main downward driver for prices.The dollar has fallen over 6 percent this year against a basket of other leading currencies.French bank BNP Paribas said that a recent oil rally, with prices jumping almost a third since April, was largely driven by sentiment and lacked physical fundamentals.""The recent rally in oil prices ... appears to have little to do with fundamentals,"" it said.""We see the recent rally as sowing the seeds of its own demise, and extending our recommendation to protect against short-term downside risk.""OPEC-supplies rose to 32.64 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, from 32.47 million bpd in March, according to a Reuters survey based on shipping data and information from sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.That almost matches January's 32.65 million bpd, when Indonesia's return to OPEC boosted production to records.Despite Monday's lower prices, other analysts are growing confident that a near-two-year rout in oil has ended, and many have raised their price forecasts.The chief of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil prices may have bottomed out, providing the health of the global economy does not pose a concern.""In a normal economic environment, we will see the price direction is rather upwards than downwards,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Sunday.Non-OPEC output is set to fall by more than 700,000 bpd this year, the biggest decline in around 20 years, he said.With global oil demand seen growing by 1.2 million bpd this year, the draw in global stockpiles will start soon, helping push up prices, he said.

ewarticle strong>FAISALABAD: As Pakistan slowly emerges from a long-term power crisis, its once booming textile sector is scrambling to find its feet -- but high energy costs and a decade lost to competitors mean recovery is far from assured.</strongEnergy production was severely depressed for more than 10 years due to chronic under-investment, inefficiencies in the power network and an inability to collect sufficient revenue to cover costs.The result was crippling for manufacturers and in particular the textile sector, which employs 30 percent of the working population.Pakistan is the world´s fourth largest cotton producing country but interminable power and gas cuts have stopped exporters from producing their orders on time.Many have watched helplessly as their clients have instead turned to Vietnam or Bangladesh.A third of the production capacity of the sector has disappeared, thousands of factories have closed, and most of the others are running below full capacity, says Rehan Bharara, a former loom owner who now runs a public infrastructure project for the textile industry.Half the time, ""we had to run our factories on diesel generators, which was very expensive. We decided to close down rather than losing money every day,"" he said.Only those manufacturers which invested heavily in their own energy production survived.These include plants run by the Sadaqat company, which provides house linen to major Western retailers such as Debenhams, Tesco and Target. Energy supply to huge printing, cutting and sewing departments is rotated according to need.""We have three sources of electricity: the main and cheapest one is generation through gas, if we don´t have gas, we go to Wapda (the public utility), if Wapda closes, we go to diesel generators,"" says chairman Mukhtar Ahmed.""I have no choice. If I stop producing, we lose our customers.""Smaller plants, notably the hundreds of thousands of cotton loom workshops, lack backup generators and are dependent on the public network.- ""No power, no wages"" -Each time the power cuts, work is interrupted.""We loom workers only get paid if there is power and looms are running. If there is no power, there are no wages,"" said Mohammad Rizwan, a 21-year-old weaver.The government has promised to end power cuts by 2018, and said industry would be prioritised.In the past few weeks, the biggest manufacturers in Faislabad have been supplied without interruption.""The key is that they give us 24 hours of electricity a day,"" said Wahid Raamay, chairman of the Council of Loom Owners in Faisalabad.Despite these important advancements, textiles are not yet out of danger. As the country´s electricity supply has improved, natural gas imports bills have gone up with the increased cost passed down to consumers.Bharara estimates the cost of electricity has doubled over eight years, from six rupees per kilowatt/hour to 11.That´s still much lower than 26 rupees per kilowatt hour for electricity produced by a diesel generator, but more than costs in competing countries.""At this time we are struggling to give competitive power,"" admits Muhammad Salim Bhatti, general manager of the city´s power distribution company. ""Over time, we will become cheaper as new power plants will be more efficient"", he hopes. ""We´ll be in a position to compete.""But the Asian Development Bank is less optimistic, citing the opaqueness of large-scale Chinese investment in the country´s energy infrastructure.""The power due to be produced by Chinese-built power plants is expected to be expensive"" it said, though it anticipates it will still be cheaper than the thermal plants they are set to replace.In late December, Pakistan´s fourth nuclear power plant went online, built with Chinese assistance as part of Islamabad´s plans to produce 8,800 MW from atomic energy by 2030.Total exports, meanwhile, 60 percent of which are made up by textiles, declined by 13 percent in the first nine months of this year compared to last, a sign that the industry´s recovery is yet to begin. 
ewarticle strong>ISLAMABAD: The tall claims of the government to end loadshedding have failed as shortfall of electricity has exceeded 6,500 megawatts in the country.</strongThe demand of electricity has reached upto 22000 MW while power generation could not be enhanced from 15,523 megawatts. The duration of loadshedding in urban areas is 12 to 14 hours while in rural areas this duration has reached from 16 to 18 hours.Owing to severe power outages, the business have stand blocked in almost all the major cities of the country. The shopkeepers in markets and bazaars have been using hand fans to meet their requirements while customers have been confined in their houses.The public circles are of the view that the government should focus on ending the line losses so that people could not face the long duration of power outages.

Current trends in oil prices and factors affecting them,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices remained near 2016 highs in early trading on Thursday, buoyed by a fall in U.S. crude inventories, a weaker dollar and strong demand, but some analysts warned that the recent rally was starting to look overblown.</strongInternational Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were trading at $52.70 per barrel at 0045 GMT, up 19 cents from their last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was 32 cents higher at $51.55 a barrel.Traders said the price rises were largely a result of a drop in U.S. crude oil inventories.Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. crude stocks last week fell by 3.23 million barrels to 532.5 million barrels, marking their third consecutive weekly fall.A weaker dollar, down around 2.4 percent this month against a basket of other currencies, makes dollar-traded fuel imports for countries using other currencies cheaper, also supporting oil prices, traders said.But some analysts said there were also signs that the recent oil price rise, which saw Brent rally 6 percent this month and prices virtually double since February to one-year highs, may be overblown.ANZ bank said that price rises were ""tempered by an increase in crude production of 10,000 barrels per day to 8.75 million barrels per day and the number of active rigs increasing by 9 to 325"".Traders also warned of an ongoing build in refined product stocks in the United States and Asia.With fundamentals weighing both for and against higher prices, many traders and analysts say that a price tag of $50-60 for a barrel of crude was a fair value for oil, reflected in Brent's forward curve which stays within that range until early 2021. 
ewarticle KARACHI: The price of petroleum products are expected to increase in June, industry sources have revealed to Geo News. The per litre price of diesel may rise by Rs6.20 and petrol by Rs5.80.  A staggering Rs11 increase may be seen in the price of HOBC. The reason for the price increase is the turmoil in Yemen which has led to an increase in crude oil price in the international market.

US crude was down 28 cents at $45.64 a barrel.Analysts said rising output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and especially the Middle East was outweighing supportive factors such as an ongoing, albeit slow, fall in U.S. output and a sliding dollar, which makes it cheaper for countries using other currencies to import dollar-traded fuel.""The weaker dollar failed to excite investors in the crude oil markets,"" ANZ bank said, citing a rise in OPEC-output as the main downward driver for prices.The dollar has fallen over 6 percent this year against a basket of other leading currencies.French bank BNP Paribas said that a recent oil rally, with prices jumping almost a third since April, was largely driven by sentiment and lacked physical fundamentals.""The recent rally in oil prices ... appears to have little to do with fundamentals,"" it said.""We see the recent rally as sowing the seeds of its own demise, and extending our recommendation to protect against short-term downside risk.""OPEC-supplies rose to 32.64 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, from 32.47 million bpd in March, according to a Reuters survey based on shipping data and information from sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.That almost matches January's 32.65 million bpd, when Indonesia's return to OPEC boosted production to records.Despite Monday's lower prices, other analysts are growing confident that a near-two-year rout in oil has ended, and many have raised their price forecasts.The chief of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil prices may have bottomed out, providing the health of the global economy does not pose a concern.""In a normal economic environment, we will see the price direction is rather upwards than downwards,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Sunday.Non-OPEC output is set to fall by more than 700,000 bpd this year, the biggest decline in around 20 years, he said.With global oil demand seen growing by 1.2 million bpd this year, the draw in global stockpiles will start soon, helping push up prices, he said.

""Upon completion of the review, SDR 360 million (about US$518 million) would be made available to Pakistan, said the outgoing chief of the IMF Mission to Pakistan Jeffery Franks.Newly-announced Chief of IMF Mission to Pakistan, Herald Finger, will replace Franks after the talks.At a jointly held press conference with the IMF staff in Dubai, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar reiterated that there would be no increase in gas and electricity prices. Pakistan also informed the IMF of its expenditure of Rs. 150 billion on the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) as well as repatriation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).Also agreed upon was Rs.60 billion in tax cuts for Pakistan, while it was decided that the target for tax cuts should reach Rs. 2750 million by June.Dar said that Pakistans foreign exchange reserves have increased to over $15 billion, entitling the country to receive subsidised loans.However, due to the price reduction of petrol in the country, tax revenue decreased to Rs. 68 billion. Tax revenues were below the second-quarter indicative target by about 0.1 percent of GDP due in part to legal challenges to some revenue measures and to the fiscal effects of the plunge in international oil prices, said a press statement from the IMF mission. While progress has been made in addressing the structural impediments to higher and more inclusive growth, important challenges remain, such as steps to enhance the independence of the SBP, permanently resolve energy sector deficiencies, complete the legal framework for deposit insurance, and privatize or restructure public enterprises, noted the IMF.

ewarticle London: Fragile financial markets are grappling with wild swings in world oil prices, unnerved by uncertainty over global supplies and the demand outlook from China.By the close of business Monday, the price had shot up 27 percent in just three days for the US benchmark contract, West Texas Intermediate for October delivery, rebounding from six and a half year lows.But they skidded again Tuesday when weak Chinese manufacturing data cemented concerns over demand from the world´s biggest commodities consumer.Later in the week oil prices got a boost from the European Central Bank, which on Thursday held out the prospect of yet more stimulus for the eurozone economies if needed.By the end of the week, crude oil prices were trading in London on Friday evening barely changed.Brent North Sea crude sold at $49.95 a barrel -- down from $50.17 a week earlier. The WTI contract traded at $46.22, up from $45.22.Crude oil, the world economy´s most important raw material, has roughly halved in price in a year.""The fall in commodity prices has looked particularly dramatic because it has included oil,"" said Julian Jessop, chief global economist and head of commodities at London-based research group Capital Economics.While many raw materials have been declining in price since 2011 as China´s booming economy began to slow, oil´s price had been propped up by a perceived threat to supply after the Arab Spring, Jessop said in an interview.""Once the concerns about the potential threat to supply from the Arab Spring disappeared and were replaced by the reality of massive oversupply because of the shale revolution in the United States and OPEC´s response of keeping production high when people had thought it might cut, then oil tanked,"" the analyst said.Keeping pressure on oil prices, Iraq has managed to boost production this year by 1.5 million barrels per day despite the conflict with extremists including Daesh group and Iran is set to raise exports as sanctions are lifted after an agreement was reached over its nuclear programme.Despite the uncertainty on commodity markets, the price of gold -- a safe haven -- lost its shine over the past week, hurt by a rally in the US dollar.The precious metal also lost its lure as a haven at as volatile Chinese markets took a holiday on Thursday and Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.On the London Bullion Market, gold was trading at $1,118.25 dollars an ounce Friday against $1.135 dollars a week before.

ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices surged during the start of 2016 trading as relations between top crude producers Saudi Arabia and Iran deteriorated, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions, though weak Asian manufacturing data kept a lid on bullish expectations.</strongSaudi Arabia, the world´s biggest oil exporter, cut diplomatic ties with Iran on Sunday in response to the storming of its embassy in Tehran.The diplomatic row between the two major oil producers escalated following Riyadh´s execution of a prominent cleric on Saturday.Global oil benchmark Brent climbed more than a dollar to a high of $38.50 per barrel on Monday, before easing back to $38.10 at 0350 GMT, still up over 2 percent.US crude´s West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were up 77 cents, or 2.08 percent, at $37.81 a barrel.Oil traders said the crisis between Saudi Arabia, also the world´s second-largest oil producer, and Iran, which holds some of the largest proven oil reserves, was pushing up prices.The clash between the two Middle Eastern rivals also comes as Iran hopes to ramp up oil exports following the expected removal of sanctions against it after reaching a deal over its alleged nuclear weapons development programme.""With increased geopolitical tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the market has put a premium on prices just when markets opened (in 2016),"" brokerage Phillip Futures said on Monday.Despite Monday´s jump, oil prices are down by two-thirds since mid-2014 on ballooning oversupply as producers including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States pump between 0.5 million and 2 million barrels of oil every day in excess of demand. 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices were stable in early trading on Monday, with global oversupply and slowing economic growth weighing on markets but prospects of falling production lending some support.</strongUS crude futures were trading at $38.41 per barrel at 0239 GMT, down 10 cents from their last settlement.But international Brent futures were up 6 cents at $40.45 a barrel.While Morgan Stanley said that oil prices had likely bottomed out, it warned that a slowing economy and high production would prevent sharp rises.""Oil prices now seem to have bottomed, even though they are likely to stay subdued for the rest of this year before starting to move higher in 2017,"" the US bank said, adding that cheap oil had not provided the economic boost to growth that many had hoped for.""When oil prices are falling below production costs, the income gains for consumers will be smaller than the costs to producers and falling oil prices become a negative-sum game,"" it said.For 2016, the bank said it was ""no longer looking for an acceleration in 2016 GDP growth"" and that the risk of a global recession was now 30 percent.Following a 70 percent price rout between mid-2014 and early 2016, oil markets are in flux.Many analysts expect a modest price recovery, while others see another slump.The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Friday said that oil prices had bottomed out due to US and other output cuts outside the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).The US rig count fell for a 12th straight week last week to a total of 386, its lowest since December 2009 as drillers continue to slash capital expenditure.Others, like Goldman Sachs, warn that ongoing global overproduction, which continues to see over 1 million barrels of crude produced in excess of demand every day, will pull prices back down again.So far, demand in core markets like China remains strong.China's January-February refinery throughput rose 4.6 percent compared to the same period a year earlier to 87.08 million tonnes (10.59 million barrels per day), official data showed on Saturday.The data release came shortly after China reported record daily crude imports of 8 million barrels per day.In traded markets, sentiment leans towards higher prices, with the amount of managed short positions open for US crude, which would profit from falling prices, down over 40 percent since mid-February, while the amount of trades betting on price increases stands near record highs.""The shift in sentiment in commodity markets continues to gather strength ... The worst may be over for commodity markets,"" ANZ bank said."
Why won't the Ministry of Water and Power renew the contract with K-Electric for 650MW?,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Water and Power issued a statement on Friday saying that the contract to supply 650MW of electricity to K-Electric cannot be renewed.The ministry went on to say that K-Electric should ensure its own production at full capacity to meet the demands.It further said that in case of an emergency shortage, at most 200 to 300MW could be provided.A summary of the decision has been sent to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.According to a K-Electric spokesperson, he warned that if the supply is stopped then there could be a possible blackout in the city as the company has no backup plan. He also said that the matter of the ministry not supplying the requirement is sub judice and could lead to contempt of court. Meanwhile, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry President Iftikhar Ahmed Vohra said that if the national grid fails to provide the required demand, industrial production may be heavily affected.He demanded from the government that it should reconsider the supply of 650MW and include it in the contract.On January 26, the ministry had directed the National Power Control Centre (NPCC) not to suspend electricity supply to K-Electric following the expiry of the power distributors 5-year agreement for 650 MW supply on January 25. According to sources, a renewed contract with fresh conditions was under consideration earlier.

However, it gets 650 MW of subsidised electricity from the national grid, he added. Asif said the issue will be reviewed in the new contract agreement with the K-Electric.The minister said the duration of loadshedding has been reduced across the country as compared to the previous year. Industries are being provided with uninterrupted electricity now, he added.To a question about the funding of Diamer Basha Dam, the power minister said the government will start construction on the project from its own resources. When asked about violations of Indus Water Treaty by India, Khawaja Asif said Pakistan is vigilant to the situation and will raise the matter at an appropriate forum in case of any violation.

Power demand growth in the kingdom is estimated at around 10 percent a year and some electricity is produced by burning crude oil which would otherwise be available to sell on the global<br/>market.Riyadh is planning to introduce nuclear and renewable energy plants, but the proposals are still at an early stage."

How has the decrease in petrol prices affected consumer behavior in Pakistan in January 2015?,"ISLAMABAD: The consistent fall in the price of petrol saw a record sale in the month of January, with a 32 percent increase as compared to January 2014.Consumers across the country bought 0.39 million tonnes of petrol in January this year.According to industry sources, the price difference between petrol and compressed natural gas (CNG) dropped from 56 percent in January 2014 to 31 percent in January 2015.Global crude oil prices have fallen by 50 percent since June 2014, and to provide consistent relief to consumers, the Pakistan government has decreased the price of petrol by Rs 29 since the last four months and brought the price of Diesel down by Rs 23 in the same time frame. 










 
ewarticle ISLAMABAD: In a move to give relief to consumers, sources in the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday that the price of petrol and petroleum products are expected to decrease further from February 1.According to sources, the price of petrol is expected to be slashed by Rs 10 per litre, High Speed Diesel by Rs 8.50 per litre, Light Diesel by Rs 11 per litre, HOBC by Rs 14 per litre, and Kerosene by Rs 12 per litre.Global crude oil prices have fallen by 50 percent since June 2014, and to provide consistent relief to consumers, the Pakistan government has decreased the price of petrol by Rs 29 since the last four months and brought the price of Diesel down by Rs 23 in the same time frame.Fuel crisis in the country began last week when Pakistan State Oil (PSO) was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country´s oil.The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps.

ewarticle KARACHI: A strike called by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association has caused a severe shortage of petrol in Karachi, Quetta and several parts of the country.The shortage comes as the government notified a decrease of Rs 3 per litre in the prices of petrol and diesel from Tuesday. Chairman Petroleum and CNG Association Shabir Sulemanji said earlier today that 30 percent of fuel stations in Karachi have run out of petrol and diesel due to the strike, expressing hope that situation would improve by Wednesday.But Geo News correspondent Ali Imran said that by now petrol was available on only about 20 to 25 percent pumping stations  those too most likely on the outskirts of Karachi. He said that there were also reports of fuel stations illegally selling petrol in black at exorbitant rates of up to Rs100 per litre.Read more: Prices of petrol, diesel slashed by Rs3 per litre Some parts of Sindh and Punjab have also begun to feel the effect of the shortage, with fears that the shortage may spiral out of control. The strike by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association, called to protest against sales tax imposed on transportation of oil, is being seen as the main reason for the shortage which is causing great difficulty for consumers.Experts and observers say the effects of the shortage are exacerbated by pumping stations not keeping enough stock and consumers waiting for prices to go down to refill their fuel tanks.

""We got quite a bit ahead of ourselves here."" Smith said it is likely still too soon for the lower US rig count to meaningfully dent supply.""Yes, there are a couple of data points, but that doesn´t mean the US is not overflowing crude,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Paris-based International Energy Agency cut its supply forecast for non-OPEC countries, citing a lower outlook for US and Canadian production and the ""worsening conflict"" in Yemen.The agency also bumped up by 90,000 barrels per day its forecast for 2015 petroleum demand.

A weak dollar can boost demand for crude, which is sold on global markets in the US currency.""A good portion of what we´re seeing during the last couple of days is a reaction to the anticipation the Fed will not change its interest rates and that´s leading to a weaker dollar,"" said James Williams of WTRG Economics."
What were the allegations against HSBC's Swiss subsidiary regarding tax evasion?,"LONDON: British bank HSBC Holdings Plc admitted on Sunday failings by its Swiss subsidiary, in response to media reports it helped wealthy customers dodge taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets.""We acknowledge and are accountable for past compliance and control failures,"" HSBC said on Sunday after news outlets including French newspaper Le Monde and Britains The Guardian published allegations about its Swiss private bank. The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing ""significantly lower"" standards of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report that the files showed HSBC's Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw bricks of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having had ""a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable tax obligations.""Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone ""a radical transformation"" in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC's Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC's Swiss private bank. HSBC said Falciani downloaded details of accounts and clients at the end of 2006 and early 2007. French authorities have obtained data on thousands of the customers and shared them with tax authorities elsewhere, including Argentina.Switzerland has charged Falciani, who Reuters was unable to reach for comment, with industrial espionage and breaching the country's secrecy laws. Falciani has previously told Reuters he is a whistleblower trying to help governments track down citizens who used Swiss accounts to evade tax.Some of the details of the list have been released before. The names of 2,000 Greeks with HSBC accounts was made public in 2010 and dubbed the ""Lagarde List"" after former French finance minister Christine Lagarde. France passed the names to Greece to help it crack down on tax evasion.                        










 
ewarticle strong>BERN: Switzerland promised on Monday to work with Indian authorities to tackle tax dodgers who stash money in Swiss bank accounts to avoid Indian taxes.</strongAfter talks in Geneva with Swiss President Johann Schneider-Ammann and round-table discussions with Swiss businessmen, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the two countries had agreed to make combatting tax evasion and ""black money"" a shared priority.""We discussed the need for an early and expeditious exchange of information to bring to justice the tax offenders. An early start to negotiations on the Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information would be important in this respect,"" he said, referring to a portal supported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Modi promised in his 2014 election campaign to recover billions of dollars sent to tax havens abroad to avoid income tax, now about 30 percent in India.Schneider-Ammann said no figure had been put on the amount of ""black money"" to be recovered. Talks would begin later this month, he said.Modi said Switzerland had also agreed to support its bid for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which it applied to join last month, having won a waiver in 2008 that accorded it the right to trade in commercial nuclear technology.New Delhi's bid for full membership of the 48-nation club, if granted, would tip the balance of power in South Asia against its arch-rival Pakistan, whose own application has been backed by China despite questions over its proliferation record.Modi tacked on Switzerland and Mexico as extra stops on a five-country tour to seek their support on joining the NSG. He left Switzerland for Washington, where U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to offer his backing also.Both Switzerland and Mexico have been viewed as sceptical about India's bid for nuclear legitimacy. They are among countries concerned that India has not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, a step that would require New Delhi to give up its nuclear arsenal.The nuclear club holds its annual meeting later this month.

ewarticle strong>ZURICH: FIFA´s ethics panel said on Saturday it had formally given outgoing President Sepp Blatter and European soccer head Michel Platini the reasons for their eight-year bans from the game, information both men could use in an appeal.</strongThe move came too late for Platini who said this week he had abandoned plans to appeal against the ban in time to rejoin the race for the FIFA presidency and withdrew his candidacy.Blatter and Platini were banned last month amid the worst corruption scandal in the history of world soccer´s governing body.""After receiving the grounds for the decisions, both officials may lodge an appeal with the FIFA Appeal Committee,"" the adjudicatory chamber of the ethics committee said in a statement, without giving details on the information it sent.The sport faces criminal investigations in Switzerland and the United States, where 41 soccer officials and sports entities have been indicted on corruption charges.Blatter and Platini were both banned over a payment of 2 million Swiss francs ($2 million) made to the Frenchman by FIFA with Blatter´s approval in 2011 for work done a decade earlier.The committee said the payment, made at a time when Blatter was seeking re-election, lacked transparency and presented conflicts of interest, though both men denied wrongdoing.Platini, the head of European soccer body UEFA, had initially been seen as the favourite to replace Blatter in the Feb. 26 election. 
ewarticle strong>BRUSSELS: European Union countries should consider taking tougher measures against banks and tax advisers who help their clients to hide money offshore, an EU Commission paper says.</strongThe document will be discussed at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Amsterdam on April 22-23, where tax evasion has been added to the agenda following the Panama Papers leaks.""The Panama Papers have highlighted how certain European financial intermediaries and other providers of tax advice appear to have actively helped their clients to conceal money offshore,"" the document, seen by Reuters, said.Banks are already subject to financial sanctions and a possible withdrawal of their operating licences if they breach EU anti-money laundering rules.The Commission wants finance ministers to consider ""more effective disincentives"" for lenders and other tax advisers who assist in tax evasion schemes, the document said.The EU executive is reviewing anti-money laundering rules and is expected to make legislative proposals by June.Under consideration are also plans to increase transparency on the ultimate ""beneficial"" owners of companies and trusts, which often are hidden, thus allowing tax evasion.Current rules oblige EU states to set up registers of firms´ owners, but do not require public disclosures.Trusts are at the moment subject to lower transparency requirements.""It would be worth considering whether improvements are possible to enhance accessibility of beneficial ownership registers, to clarify the registration requirements for trusts,"" the EU Commission paper said.The Commission this year proposed measures to tackle tax dodging, urged large companies to reveal their tax data and called for a EU list of tax havens which should be subject to common sanctions.Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis called on EU states to make ""substantive progress"" on all these issues in a letter sent to the Dutch presidency of the EU ahead of the Amsterdam finance ministers´ meeting."
future predictions for global oil prices by IEA,"London: World oil prices sank Friday after the International Energy Agency warned over the price outlook amid bulging global supplies.In midday London deals, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery fell 57 cents to $56.51 a barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April shed 72 cents to $46.33 a barrel.""Crude oil prices extended losses ... as investors remained cautious following the bearish IEA oil monthly report, high levels of crude oil inventories and the strong US dollar rally,"" said Sucden analyst Myrto Sokou.The Paris-based IEA energy watchdog warned Friday that the recent rebound in oil prices was built on flimsy foundations.Prices collapsed by 60 percent to about $40 between June and late January due to global oil oversupply, a weak world economy and the strong dollar.However, the market has since rebounded somewhat following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities.""Behind the facade of stability, the rebalancing triggered by the price collapse has yet to run its course, and it might be overly optimistic to expect it to proceed smoothly,"" said the Paris-based IEA, which advises energy consuming nations.It noted that a key driver in the recovery in oil prices has been drops in the number of rigs drilling for shale oil in the United States.""Yet US supply so far shows precious little sign of slowing down. Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations,"" said the IEA in its monthly report, which sharply revised up output estimates for the end of last year and forecasts for the start of 2015.The IEA hiked its demand forecasts for every quarter this year, with the annual 2015 figure bumped up by 100,000 barrels per day to 93.5 mbpd, compared with its previous forecast given last month.In earlier Asian trading, the oil market had risen on news of a deal to end a strike at US refineries.Crude futures had fallen Thursday after a government report showed surging US stockpiles, adding to a global oversupply.The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said inventories hit a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week, while stockpiles at the Cushing terminal hub in Oklahoma -- the price settlement point for WTI -- also increased.Bloomberg News meanwhile reported the United Steelworkers union representing 30,000 US oil workers had reached a tentative deal on a four-year contract with Royal Dutch Shell that could see a mass walkout brought to a close.Another development affecting the market was an announcement on Monday by the US Energy Information Administration raising its crude production forecast this year to 9.35 million barrels per day from 9.30 million.

ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices resumed their decline in Asia Wednesday, with global crude oversupply continuing to dampen investors´ sentiment despite occasional rallies.Prices had risen the previous day after a four-day losing streak, as traders weighed a bearish price outlook from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and a lowered US estimate for crude production.The oil market has collapsed by more than half since mid-2014 with prices languishing under $50 a barrel, hurt by the supply glut and the decision by the oil exporter grouping OPEC to maintain output to counter booming US shale production.The Paris-based IEA, in a report Tuesday, forecast that the global oil market would recover to $80 a barrel by 2020.At around 0300 GMT Wednesday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was trading 47 cents lower at $43.74 and Brent crude for December was down 26 cents at $47.18.""We continue to think the market will remain in surplus through most of 2016, which is likely to restrict the upside for prices, particularly over the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016,"" British bank Barclays said in a market commentary.A strong dollar, fuelled by widening expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, has also been keeping a lid on prices.Oil is traded in the US currency and a buoyant dollar would make the commodity more expensive for those holding weaker units, lowering demand and prices.""We expect the greenback to continue to be supported as we approach the likely lift-off in rates,"" Singapore´s United Overseas Bank said, referring to a December 17 meeting of the Fed´s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. 










 
ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia on Tuesday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted that global oil prices will recover only partially over the next five years, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery slipped 74 cents to $52.12, while Brent crude for March eased 77 cents to $57.57 in afternoon trade. Citing a major shakeup in the oil markets, the IEA said in its five-year forecast that prices will recover from current levels of around $50-60 per barrel but remain considerably below the more than $100 price tags reached the slump began in June.""The global oil market looks set to begin a new chapter of its history, with markedly changing demand dynamics, sweeping shifts in crude trade and product supply, and dramatically different roles for OPEC and non-OPEC producers in regulating upstream supply,"" the IEA said.It added that it sees market rebalancing occurring ""relatively swiftly"", with increases in inventories halting mid-year and the market tightening.""This morning´s slight dip is likely due to the IEA report that predicts only a slow recovery for oil prices. However this is only in the short term as the market fundamentals have not changed,"" said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts.Prices have plunged from their mid-2014 peaks largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production and weak global demand.

ewarticle strong>LONDON: The world will store unwanted oil for most of 2016 as declines in U.S. output take time and OPEC is unlikely to cut a deal with other producers to reduce ballooning output, the International Energy Agency said.</strongThe agency, which coordinates energy policies of industrialised countries, said that while it did not believe oil prices could follow some of the most extreme forecasts and fall to as low as $10 per barrel, it was equally hard to see how they could rise significantly from current levels.The Paris-based IEA trimmed its forecast for 2016 oil demand growth, which now stands at 1.17 million barrels per day (bpd) following a five-year high of 1.6 million in 2015.It cut its call on OPEC crude for 2016 by 100,000 bpd to 31.7 million bpd. That figure is much lower than OPEC's January output of 32.63 million bpd.""Persistent speculation about a deal between OPEC and leading non-OPEC producers to cut output appears to be just that: speculation. It is OPEC's business whether or not it makes output cuts either alone or in concert with other producers but the likelihood of coordinated cuts is very low,"" the IEA said.Oil prices collapsed over the past 18 months to below $30 a barrel from as high as $115 as OPEC opened its taps to drive higher-cost producers such as U.S. shale companies out of the market.Low oil prices have spurred global demand but it was not enough to absorb all crude produced. As a result, unwanted oil went into storage, leading to record global stockpiles of over 3 billion barrels.U.S. shale oil output has started to decline because of low prices and OPEC has said it sees the market rebalancing sometime later in 2016 when demand finally meets supply.But the IEA said supply may still exceed demand throughout the whole of 2016 and added it saw non-OPEC output falling by just 0.6 million bpd in 2016.""The number could be higher of course and many senior international oil company figures have said so but there is a lingering feeling that the big fall-off in production from U.S. shale producers is taking an awful long time to happen. Perhaps resilience still has some way to go,"" the IEA said.The agency also said it saw the dollar remaining strong as it benefits from its safe-haven status, meaning more downward pressure on oil prices.With weaker global oil demand, likely new gains in Iraqi, Iranian and Saudi output, low chances of an OPEC deal, resilient U.S. production and a strong dollar - the IEA said the global oil glut was only poised to worsen.It said that even if OPEC production remained flat, global stocks would build by 2 million bpd in the first quarter, followed by a 1.5-million-bpd build in the second quarter.""Supply and demand data for the second half of the year suggests more stock building, this time by 0.3 million bpd. If these numbers prove to be accurate, and with the market already awash in oil, it is very hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly in the short term. In these conditions the short-term risk to the downside has increased. 
ewarticle London: World crude prices diverged Tuesday as traders eyed weak demand and excess supplies, dealers said.Brent North Sea crude for October dropped eight cents to stand at $46.29 a barrel around late afternoon in London.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in October added 86 cents to $44.85 per barrel compared with Monday´s close.Expectations that US crude oil inventories expanded for a third week and news that the OPEC cartel has slashed its demand growth forecast for next year are keeping a lid on any price rally, analysts said.Bloomberg News said it expects US crude stockpiles to have risen by 1.75 million barrels in the week to September 4.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release Wednesday the official stockpiles data, a gauge of demand in the world´s top oil consuming nation.""Prices are unable to make much headway as the market expects US crude stockpiles to expand for the third straight week ahead of the EIA report,"" said Bernard Aw, a Singapore-based strategist at IG Markets.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Monday cut its 2016 forecast for global demand ""due to the projected slower economic momentum in Latin America and China"".The cartel said demand would grow by 1.29 million barrels per day to 94.08 million barrels a day next year, 50,000 barrels less than its previous estimate.Traders are also watching out for the US Federal Reserve meeting this week to see whether policymakers would raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.Analysts say that a hike in the zero-level benchmark rate would likely push the dollar higher, making dollar-priced crude oil more expensive and potentially further damping demand.

What led to the suspension of the Intra-Kashmir trade service at the Chakothi crossing point?,"MUZAFFARABAD: The Intra-Kashmir trade service will resume tonight after six days of its suspension at the Chakothi crossing point, Geo News reported on Wednesday.The trade service was suspended after authorities in Indian occupied Kashmir leveled allegations of smuggling.It was suspended when a truck from Azad Kashmir was stopped by Indian authorities allegedly said to be carrying contraband.According to Director General (DG) Azad Kashmir Trade and Travel Authority (TATA) Brigadier (R)Imtiaz Wayen, 50 trucks from AJK and 21 from IoK will return tonight.On Sunday in an interview with AFP, Basharat Iqbal, trade facilitation officer on the Pakistani side of the border said: We were informed by the Indian authorities on Friday evening that they have stopped 22 Pakistani trucks which crossed the Line of Control (LOC) earlier that day.""""They told us that they had discovered 12 kilograms (26 pounds) of opium from a truck carrying oranges and were taking an action against the driver. After the incident, we also held 50 Indian trucks on Pakistani Kashmir side, because traffic crosses the border simultaneously,"" said Iqbal.Imtiaz Wayen, director-general of Pakistani Kashmir´s trade and travel authority, said India was not entitled to stop Pakistani drivers on grounds of smuggling.""According to our agreement, if they find any banned item in our trucks they are bound to hand over that item and the relevant truck driver to us for further action,"" he said.

ewarticle KARACHI: A strike by freight forwarders and air cargo agents is piling up cargo containers at the countrys main port as delays in offloading and taking on new cargo is causing fears that a prolonged stand-off will cost the economy billions of rupees.The strike, observed in protest against eight percent turnover tax, entered the second day on Wednesday, bringing the external trade to nearly halt, said a protesting leader.Pakistan International Freight Forwarders Association (PIFFA) and Air Cargo Agents Association of Pakistan (ACAAP) had announced strike for indefinite period until government resolves all the issues, which include withdrawal of the turnover tax.Farukh Iqbal, chairman of Air Cargo Agents Association of Pakistan (ACAAP) said there was no bill of leading for exporters to ship goods through dry ports/sea ports/airports/bonded container freight station.No one from governments side came forward to negotiate with us, he said.We have written several letters to the Federal Board of Revenue, finance ministry and Prime Ministers secretariat, but the government was not ready to listen to our grievances.Even various trade bodies took up this issue with the government, which seems to be indifferent to trade and commerce, he added. The cargo agents leader said since no government official had contacted them on Wednesday they decided to continue the strike.Our members are not responsible or liable for any direct or consequential losses suffered by trade due to strike as government has forced our member companies to take the extreme decision to close businesses in protest against the imposition of this unjust tax, which itself means closure of businesses, he said.An official at a leading terminal operator of Karachi port told The News that the strike had already slowed down the activities.If this situation persists for another four to five days the goods waiting for clearance will pile up to create menace, he said. And, it will take 20 to 25 days or even more to do clearance in addition to jack up the operational cost for exporters and importers in form of extra port duties.He added that the government is not realising the fact.Freight forwarders didnt issue any bill of leading for exports and there was no delivery order for lifting the import consignment at terminals. If the situation persists it will create handling issues.Perishable export/import items can be ruined if not cleared on time.The terminal operator said clearing agents and freight forwarders dont work on high turnovers and higher taxes can lead to the closure of their businesses.A leading exporter Jawed Bilwani said governments non-serious attitude to resolve any industry issue is marring trade. The countrys exports are already suffering and with the ongoing strike of the freight forwarders and other stakeholders will further hamper the exports.Bilwani said last year good transporters called strike and the government didnt seriously take the issue. It was only after 12 days, during which traders sustained huge losses the government came for negotiation with the protestors.He said the present government allows an issue to blow out of proportion before coming for the rescue.Fawad Ijaz Khan, Patron-in-Chief of Pakistan Leather Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association said the government has failed to resolve the issues facing freight forwarders and air cargo agents.We have been trying to contact the various ministries, including finance and commerce ministries, but no one was available to listen to our grievances, Khan said.Our members are worried about their consignments and their orders might be cancelled if not shipped on time.Shabbir Ahmed, former chairman of Pakistan Bedwear Exporters Association said the government should seriously take notice of the matter and immediately resolve the issues of the logistics sector. Ahmed said small exporters will suffer the most due to the strike.

Under Cricket Australia (CA) contracts, players are given a six-week break from commitments, which many use to sign lucrative IPL contracts.Lehmann said that while the financial incentive to play in India was tempting, it often wore players out and the ICC should use a common sense approach to future scheduling so that the toll on bodies was not too high.""If it keeps going like this, with players playing IPL as well, they are inevitably going to break down,"" Lehmann told Australian media on Friday.""Hopefully changes will happen at the ICC and then you will see a refined schedule which will be better.""Lehmann said while players often consider setting themselves up for life by playing in the IPL, it was a ""tough conundrum"" for national selectors, as they are reluctant to advise players not to take on out-of-contract commitments.""If you look across a two-year cycle, all of our players have had to come home at some point,"" he said, while referring to injuries Steve Smith (wrist) and Mitchell Marsh (hamstring) picked up in the most recent IPL season.Lehmann believes that while players may be primed to perform under match day stresses, it was the constant travel, variable conditions and lack of adequate rest which was putting them most at risk.""It's not so much the cricket; it's the travel to these places. You're on the road, you have training and all that stuff,"" he said.The ICC is currently considering the introduction of a two-tiered test Championship and a one-day league, which would go some way to lightening the workload.

ewarticle strong>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will have more than 40 million smartphones by end of this year 2016 as increase in number of mobile broadband users have registered a reasonable growth.</strongBased on current trends in e commerce sector and as per market estimates more than two million users a month are looking to buy a phone online and to capitalise on this growing demand major industry players from service providers (telecom operators) to mobile phone makers and an e commerce platform have partnered with internet giant Google to promote online trade by offering exclusive discounts on mobile phone purchases just ahead of Eidul Fitr.In Pakistan third generation (3G) and 4G mobile phone users stand at 27 million as of May 2016 and continue to grow creating a huge demand for smartphones which is the top selling category across all major e commerce platforms.Publicly available data shows mobile phone imports in terms of value and not in units making it difficult to figure out category wise imports.However market sources say less than 20% of Pakistans monthly mobile phone imports comprises smartphones.This equation though is likely to change in a couple of years, they added.It merits mentioned that Pakistan s e commerce market is still in its infancy and represents only 5 % of conventional retail trade.However the overall size of this fast growing segment has come close to 100 million up by two thirds from 60 million as of 2014. A bulk of the countrys e-commerce transactions originate from Karachi Lahore Islamabad and Rawalpindi which comprise about 50% of customers.The remaining customer base is very thinly split between cities and towns nationwide.With telecom operators rolling out 3G and 4G services in semi urban and rural areas of the country   which usually don t have outlets for branded products   the e commerce market is likely to benefit a great deal. 
ewarticle The advent of mobile and smartphone technology has transformed the dynamics of communication in Pakistan. The adoption rates for smartphones are growing rapidly in both urban and rural centers. In 2015, 31% of mobiles purchased in the country were smartphones. Pakistan has approximately 80% mobile user penetration. These mobile phones have become so common that they are not considered a luxury device anymore but rather, an item of necessity. This technology has the potential to solve various day-to-day problems and the ability to lift people out of poverty. In fact, in the life of every individual, a mobile phone plays a critical role.   The reason behind a common man owning a phone can be attributed to price affordability and availability of quality smartphones within the reach of the masses. There are some big names is Pakistans smartphone market, but the role which Q Mobile has played for equipping the masses with mobile and smartphones has to be applauded. Q Mobile, which is the largest smartphone brand in Pakistan and enjoys a lion's share in the smartphone market, provides various kinds of phones such as smartphones, feature phones and tablets. It is clearly evident that, from a shopkeeper to a businessman, Q Mobile serves all Socio - Economic Classes.Once upon a time, these phones were used to send a message or receive a call but now, with all telecom operators providing affordable data services, the use of smartphones takes a completely new level of information.We now have access to mobile payment solutions, where we can send or receive money from distant areas within a fraction of seconds. We can shop online and pay via our mobile phones, connect with our loved ones living abroad via video calling, social networking and staying ever connected with all the news from around the world.Very soon, our farmers will check the daily commodity rate or inquire about delivery to the market. Long distance route truck drivers, who transport goods, can use online maps and GPS to plan their routes. Traders in the rural areas can narrow the gap with their buyers and sellers in urban areas by using mobile broadband. Health related services are also available via smartphones. A recent study by the Santa Fe Institute theorizes that cell phone use could help developing countries plan electrical infrastructure.With so much developments taking place, smartphones clearly represent a growing segment of our economy and are an example of how the availability of technology can propel Pakistan in the global marketplace while improving the lives of a common man at the same time.

What are the new tax increases and regulatory duties introduced by the Pakistani government?,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan must raise an extra $379 million (about Rs40 billion) through new tax measures, the finance minister said on Monday, as the government seeks to qualify for its latest IMF loan tranche.Earlier this month, the IMF approved the release in December of a $502 million tranche of Pakistan´s three-year $6.68 billion programme, even though the government missed targets for tax revenue generation, net domestic assets and the budget deficit.The government will levy an additional 5 to 10 percentage points of tax on 350 items and raise customs duty by 1 percentage point, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said at a press conference in the federal capital.The full list of items was not immediately available.The increased levies would target ""non-essential luxury items"" only, and exemptions on the customs duty have been offered for 25 key industrial sectors, Dar said on Monday.""We have kept in mind not to increase duties that would make items more expensive for the common man,"" he said.Separate increased taxes were also announced on imported automobiles - both new and used - and domestically-produced cigarettes.In its last review, the International Monetary Fund had warned that the release of December´s approved $502 million tranche depended on the announcement of new measures to generate an extra 40 billion Pakistan rupees ($380 million) in revenue. ""This was a deadline in a sense, and if the government didn´t do it the next tranche of the programme would at least be delayed, if not suspended,"" Khurram Husain, an economic analyst and journalist, told Reuters.It was unclear if the new measures would meet the target.Dar had earlier told a parliamentary standing committee that the increased duties were meant to restrict Pakistan´s import bill, not increase revenue.Husain said if the measures did not raise enough funds, the government would have to raise taxes on staples such as electricity and petrol.

ewarticle ISLAMABAD: The Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) has begun chasing wealthy tax-dodgers who enjoy lives of extravagance and luxury, but revenue officials face huge challenges in trying to force the very richest  and most influential  to pay up.Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio of 9.5 percent is among the lowest in the world and the government is under pressure from foreign donors and lenders, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to increase collection to boost the struggling economy.Revenue authorities say they have identified about a quarter of a million new taxpayers who they project will add around 14 billion rupees ($140 million) to government coffers.Broadening the tax base and improving the economy after years of drift and sluggish growth under the last government was a key pledge in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif´s 2013 election campaign, when he was swept to power for a third time.Currently less than one percent of Pakistanis pay income tax and the government collected just $8 billion in total income tax in the 2013-14 fiscal year  barely enough to cover just the country´s defence expenditure of $7 billion.The finance ministry is aiming to boost the tax-to-GDP ratio to 15 percent in the current fiscal year ending June 30.As part of those efforts, the FBR is compiling lifestyle and vehicle data to try to trace unregistered taxpayers, including wealthy landlords and businessmen zipping between their luxury homes in imported Mercedes.""We are collecting information from the vehicle registration authority, car manufacturers, utility companies, telecom companies and property registration offices and tracing people who are not paying any tax,"" FBR spokesman Shahid Hussain told AFP.Taxpayer profilesThe data is used to generate profiles of potential taxpayers, after which demands are issued for them to pay income tax.""FBR has already issued notices to 261,250 potential tax payers,"" Hussain told AFP, adding that that new taxpayers have paid 570 million rupees since the crackdown started.It is not just dodgy businessmen who have been caught  several lawmakers have been found paying either no tax or very little and not filing their mandatory annual tax statements.The FBR has taken punitive measures against some ""chronic defaulters"", freezing nearly 300 bank accounts, seizing more than 100 vehicles, putting 78 properties up for sale and issuing arrest warrants in 40 cases.""Employing information technology, the FBR is creating a central database which would contain information about all taxpayers and nobody will be left undetected,"" Hussain said.A new FBR department tasked with broadening the tax net started working in July 2013 and within one year it started showing results, he added.But Pakistan is a country where wealth and political influence go hand in hand. For generations, landowners and industrialists have given patronage to political parties and scant attention has been paid to their assets by the taxman.Changing this privileged arrangement is a tricky proposition.Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for Pakistani daily The News who has done several major exposes on tax-dodgers, says the FBR´s commitment is encouraging, but he does not expect them to net any big fish.´War on tax cheats´""FBR is after those who can´t influence them,"" Cheema told AFP, citing several well-known tycoons considered among Pakistan´s richest whose names were missing from a list of the country´s top 100 taxpayers.""It can be done only by waging a war against tax cheaters without discrimination of good and bad cheaters,"" Cheema said.Pakistan´s central bank said in a recent report that tax revenue growth was not keeping up with budget targets.The tax take grew 11.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, against an annual target of 26.9 percent  but this was only half the growth of the same period during the previous fiscal year, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The central bank has urged the government to simplify tax procedures and do more to increase the documentation of the economy.A vast amount of business in Pakistan is done off the books, making transactions hard to trace and levy dues on.""Although FBR has taken a number of measures to increase tax collection, these focused more on deductions at source, and/or increasing the tax rates,"" a recent SBP report said, warning such measures had enjoyed ""limited success"" in the past.The IMF, though, has said the government´s reform programme  tied to a $6.6 billion loan from the Washington-based lender  was on track, and expects growth to accelerate to 4.3 percent in the 2014-15 fiscal year from 4.1 percent previously.But even with growth quickening and officials insisting they are making inroads, challenges to the government´s efforts to gather taxes remain considerable.

current trends in oil prices and stockpile levels,"strong>TOKYO: Oil prices fell on Tuesday as concerns mount that a rally since January is fizzling out, while analysts forecast another rise to record levels for US crude stockpiles.</strongUS oil CLc1 was down 30 cents at $39.09 a barrel at 0553 GMT, after finishing down 7 cents at $39.39, the previous session.Brent LCOc1 fell 35 cents to $39.92. On Monday it settled down 17 cents at $40.27 a barrel.US commercial crude oil stockpiles were expected to have reached record highs for a seventh straight week, while refined product inventories likely fell, a preliminary Reuters survey showed late on Monday.The poll of eight analysts, taken ahead of weekly inventory reports from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA), estimated, on average, that crude stocks rose 3.2 million barrels in the week ended March 25.The API will release its data on Tuesday at 2030 GMT, while the EIA will publish its data on Wednesday at 1430 GMT.Both oil benchmarks are up about 50 percent from 12-year lows hit in mid-February but the oil market has taken on a weaker tone in the past week, along with other commodities.""The numbers continue to suggest a supply glut and I suspect that more talk is relevant out of OPEC and Co to help the price stand up or to help it remain relatively stable,"" said Jonathan Barratt, Chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance in Sydney.He was referring to plans by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major suppliers including Russia to meet next month to discuss an output freeze in the hope they can support prices.The plans for the April 17 meeting in Qatar have been a major component of the rally.But with stockpiles high and signs that some OPEC members are losing market share, along with few signs of demand returning, prices are likely to trade in a range.""The likes of Russia and the likes of Iran ... are cutting deals left right and centre just to get cash flow,"" said Barratt.""Given the absence of economic numbers supporting increases in demand we continue to go sideways,"" he said.Most analysts are predicting the end of the year-and-a-half long slump, but also betting that there is little upside in the near future.Barclays said net flows into commodities totalled more than $20 billion in January-February, the strongest start to a year since 2011, and prices could fall 20 to 25 percent if that were reversed.""Were such a scenario to unfold, the price of oil could fall back to the low $30s,"" it said on Monday. 
ewarticle London: Oil prices rebounded slightly Tuesday after recent sharp losses caused by an oversupplied market.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April delivery rose 39 cents to $49.84 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for April climbed 51 cents to stand at $59.41 a barrel in London afternoon deals.WTI shed $1.36 in New York and Brent lost $1.32 on Monday, building on heavy losses last Friday, as US crude stockpiles linger at historic levels, contributing to a global oversupply.A closely watched report on US weekly crude stockpiles is next due on Wednesday, with a Bloomberg News survey saying inventories are expected to have risen by 3.75 million barrels.US oil stockpiles are already at their highest level on record at this time of year.""The expectation of further rising US crude oil stocks is pressuring prices,"" said Commerzbank analysts in a note to clients.Globally, crude supplies are also being boosted after oilfields in eastern Libya resumed pumping to the port of Hariga after a pipeline was repaired, and oil producer Oman plans to ramp up output to 980,000 barrels a day this year.""The partial return of supply from Libya is weighing on the Brent price despite its sustainability being anything but certain,"" said Commerzbank.Crude prices lost about 60 percent of their value to about $40 between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and a strong dollar.Prices have risen above multi-year lows following a slowdown in US oil drilling activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.""It is apparent by now that drilling in the US will slow, global production growth is expected to be lower, and demand, at least in the US, is reacting positively to lower prices,"" British bank Barclays said in a report.""In short, the market is forecast to remain oversupplied for most of 2015, but expectations beyond that are for more balanced fundamentals.""

ewarticle New York: Oil prices fell on Wednesday before the release of a report on US crude inventories as traders kept an eye on unrest in crude exporter Libya.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in March shed $1.39 to $52.14 a barrel compared with Tuesday´s close.European benchmark Brent oil for April delivery slid $2.00 to $60.53 a barrel in London.The US Department of Energy will release its weekly stockpiles report on Thursday with many analysts expecting another large rise in stocks.Last week´s report showed that US crude inventories reached their highest levels on record for this time of the year.""The market had a very nice rebound from the $44-45 low it made a little while back,"" said Kyle Cooper, analyst at IAF Advisors in Houston.""But the fundamentals are still on the downside, and expectations are for a crude oil build"" on Thursday.""I don´t think the production growth is going to slow in the next couple of months.""Although leading producers like Chevron and ConocoPhillips have slashed capital budgets in light of the more than 50 percent plunge in global crude prices, the cuts are not expected to significantly affect short-term production levels.Traders were also keeping an eye on developments in north African crude oil producer Libya.Infighting and sabotage in Libya has reduced output to 150,000 barrels a day, down from a high of almost 1.5 million barrels per day, according to analysts.

ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices extended their losses in Asia Wednesday to new six-year lows on expectations US crude stockpiles will rise further, in a market already awash with supplies, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for April delivery eased 83 cents to $42.63 in afternoon trade, the lowest level since March 2009.Brent crude for May fell 14 cents to $53.37 a barrel.""We expect the US stockpiles to increase further and this will exacerbate the market´s supply concerns,"" said David Lennox, a resource analyst with Fat Prophets in Sydney.A Bloomberg News survey showed US crude stockpiles are expected to have increased by 3.3 million barrels to another record 452.2 million in the week ending March 13.The US Energy Information Administration will release the final figure later Wednesday.US stockpiles have risen for nine weeks in a row, each time touching a record, helping push prices lower in a market already weighed down by a supply glut after the OPEC oil cartel decided in November to maintain elevated output levels.World oil prices have collapsed by about 60 percent since June as supply outpaces demand.Lennox said the gloomy market outlook will only shift if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) -- which is dominated by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries -- decides to slash production.""At the moment we are keeping our eyes on OPEC,"" he said, adding: ""They have a meeting in June and we are hopeful they will decide to cut production.""

ewarticle London: World crude prices diverged Tuesday as traders eyed weak demand and excess supplies, dealers said.Brent North Sea crude for October dropped eight cents to stand at $46.29 a barrel around late afternoon in London.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in October added 86 cents to $44.85 per barrel compared with Monday´s close.Expectations that US crude oil inventories expanded for a third week and news that the OPEC cartel has slashed its demand growth forecast for next year are keeping a lid on any price rally, analysts said.Bloomberg News said it expects US crude stockpiles to have risen by 1.75 million barrels in the week to September 4.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release Wednesday the official stockpiles data, a gauge of demand in the world´s top oil consuming nation.""Prices are unable to make much headway as the market expects US crude stockpiles to expand for the third straight week ahead of the EIA report,"" said Bernard Aw, a Singapore-based strategist at IG Markets.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Monday cut its 2016 forecast for global demand ""due to the projected slower economic momentum in Latin America and China"".The cartel said demand would grow by 1.29 million barrels per day to 94.08 million barrels a day next year, 50,000 barrels less than its previous estimate.Traders are also watching out for the US Federal Reserve meeting this week to see whether policymakers would raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.Analysts say that a hike in the zero-level benchmark rate would likely push the dollar higher, making dollar-priced crude oil more expensive and potentially further damping demand.                        










"
What are the recent trends in global oil prices?,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices remained near 2016 highs in early trading on Thursday, buoyed by a fall in U.S. crude inventories, a weaker dollar and strong demand, but some analysts warned that the recent rally was starting to look overblown.</strongInternational Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were trading at $52.70 per barrel at 0045 GMT, up 19 cents from their last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was 32 cents higher at $51.55 a barrel.Traders said the price rises were largely a result of a drop in U.S. crude oil inventories.Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. crude stocks last week fell by 3.23 million barrels to 532.5 million barrels, marking their third consecutive weekly fall.A weaker dollar, down around 2.4 percent this month against a basket of other currencies, makes dollar-traded fuel imports for countries using other currencies cheaper, also supporting oil prices, traders said.But some analysts said there were also signs that the recent oil price rise, which saw Brent rally 6 percent this month and prices virtually double since February to one-year highs, may be overblown.ANZ bank said that price rises were ""tempered by an increase in crude production of 10,000 barrels per day to 8.75 million barrels per day and the number of active rigs increasing by 9 to 325"".Traders also warned of an ongoing build in refined product stocks in the United States and Asia.With fundamentals weighing both for and against higher prices, many traders and analysts say that a price tag of $50-60 for a barrel of crude was a fair value for oil, reflected in Brent's forward curve which stays within that range until early 2021. 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices were stable in early trading on Monday, with global oversupply and slowing economic growth weighing on markets but prospects of falling production lending some support.</strongUS crude futures were trading at $38.41 per barrel at 0239 GMT, down 10 cents from their last settlement.But international Brent futures were up 6 cents at $40.45 a barrel.While Morgan Stanley said that oil prices had likely bottomed out, it warned that a slowing economy and high production would prevent sharp rises.""Oil prices now seem to have bottomed, even though they are likely to stay subdued for the rest of this year before starting to move higher in 2017,"" the US bank said, adding that cheap oil had not provided the economic boost to growth that many had hoped for.""When oil prices are falling below production costs, the income gains for consumers will be smaller than the costs to producers and falling oil prices become a negative-sum game,"" it said.For 2016, the bank said it was ""no longer looking for an acceleration in 2016 GDP growth"" and that the risk of a global recession was now 30 percent.Following a 70 percent price rout between mid-2014 and early 2016, oil markets are in flux.Many analysts expect a modest price recovery, while others see another slump.The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Friday said that oil prices had bottomed out due to US and other output cuts outside the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).The US rig count fell for a 12th straight week last week to a total of 386, its lowest since December 2009 as drillers continue to slash capital expenditure.Others, like Goldman Sachs, warn that ongoing global overproduction, which continues to see over 1 million barrels of crude produced in excess of demand every day, will pull prices back down again.So far, demand in core markets like China remains strong.China's January-February refinery throughput rose 4.6 percent compared to the same period a year earlier to 87.08 million tonnes (10.59 million barrels per day), official data showed on Saturday.The data release came shortly after China reported record daily crude imports of 8 million barrels per day.In traded markets, sentiment leans towards higher prices, with the amount of managed short positions open for US crude, which would profit from falling prices, down over 40 percent since mid-February, while the amount of trades betting on price increases stands near record highs.""The shift in sentiment in commodity markets continues to gather strength ... The worst may be over for commodity markets,"" ANZ bank said. 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices dipped in early Asian trade on Monday as rising production in the Middle East outweighed falling US output and the recent slide in the dollar, which has been supporting crude.</strongBrent futures were trading at $47.05 (32 pounds) per barrel at 0028 GMT on Monday, down 32 cents from their last settlement. US crude was down 28 cents at $45.64 a barrel.Analysts said rising output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and especially the Middle East was outweighing supportive factors such as an ongoing, albeit slow, fall in U.S. output and a sliding dollar, which makes it cheaper for countries using other currencies to import dollar-traded fuel.""The weaker dollar failed to excite investors in the crude oil markets,"" ANZ bank said, citing a rise in OPEC-output as the main downward driver for prices.The dollar has fallen over 6 percent this year against a basket of other leading currencies.French bank BNP Paribas said that a recent oil rally, with prices jumping almost a third since April, was largely driven by sentiment and lacked physical fundamentals.""The recent rally in oil prices ... appears to have little to do with fundamentals,"" it said.""We see the recent rally as sowing the seeds of its own demise, and extending our recommendation to protect against short-term downside risk.""OPEC-supplies rose to 32.64 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, from 32.47 million bpd in March, according to a Reuters survey based on shipping data and information from sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.That almost matches January's 32.65 million bpd, when Indonesia's return to OPEC boosted production to records.Despite Monday's lower prices, other analysts are growing confident that a near-two-year rout in oil has ended, and many have raised their price forecasts.The chief of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil prices may have bottomed out, providing the health of the global economy does not pose a concern.""In a normal economic environment, we will see the price direction is rather upwards than downwards,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Sunday.Non-OPEC output is set to fall by more than 700,000 bpd this year, the biggest decline in around 20 years, he said.With global oil demand seen growing by 1.2 million bpd this year, the draw in global stockpiles will start soon, helping push up prices, he said. 
ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices edged up in Asia Thursday, lifted by bargain-hunting following a sharp decline the day before, although analysts said the market remains hobbled by an oversupply of the commodity.A report released Wednesday showing a bigger-than-expected increase in US crude stockpiles has stoked fresh worries about a global glut that has depressed oil prices for more than a year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December rose 25 cents to $45.45 and Brent crude for December climbed 21 cents to $48.06 a barrel at around 0300 GMT.The rebound followed Wednesday´s steep fall after the US Energy Information Administration said the country´s commercial crude-oil inventories jumped by eight million barrels to 476.6 million in the week ending October 16.The increase, which typically indicates weaker demand in the world´s number one economy, was more than double market expectations.Oil prices took a hit at the start of the week when China said gross domestic product grew in the third quarter at its slowest pace in more than six years.""Worries about the health of the Chinese economy continue to batter commodities prices. In the US, crude stockpiles surged ... and supply glut remains a concern,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.Gupta said a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers on Wednesday ""did not produce any meaningful results as no potential production cuts were addressed"".Russia had said it was prepared to discuss a reduction with members of the cartel at the meeting in Vienna.Gupta said the market will be looking at a December 4 policy-setting meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries which is expected to ""provide vital clues about price development in the medium term"".OPEC, which includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, has maintained high production levels despite the oil price decline, as members seek to maintain market share.                        










 
ewarticle London: Fragile financial markets are grappling with wild swings in world oil prices, unnerved by uncertainty over global supplies and the demand outlook from China.By the close of business Monday, the price had shot up 27 percent in just three days for the US benchmark contract, West Texas Intermediate for October delivery, rebounding from six and a half year lows.But they skidded again Tuesday when weak Chinese manufacturing data cemented concerns over demand from the world´s biggest commodities consumer.Later in the week oil prices got a boost from the European Central Bank, which on Thursday held out the prospect of yet more stimulus for the eurozone economies if needed.By the end of the week, crude oil prices were trading in London on Friday evening barely changed.Brent North Sea crude sold at $49.95 a barrel -- down from $50.17 a week earlier. The WTI contract traded at $46.22, up from $45.22.Crude oil, the world economy´s most important raw material, has roughly halved in price in a year.""The fall in commodity prices has looked particularly dramatic because it has included oil,"" said Julian Jessop, chief global economist and head of commodities at London-based research group Capital Economics.While many raw materials have been declining in price since 2011 as China´s booming economy began to slow, oil´s price had been propped up by a perceived threat to supply after the Arab Spring, Jessop said in an interview.""Once the concerns about the potential threat to supply from the Arab Spring disappeared and were replaced by the reality of massive oversupply because of the shale revolution in the United States and OPEC´s response of keeping production high when people had thought it might cut, then oil tanked,"" the analyst said.Keeping pressure on oil prices, Iraq has managed to boost production this year by 1.5 million barrels per day despite the conflict with extremists including Daesh group and Iran is set to raise exports as sanctions are lifted after an agreement was reached over its nuclear programme.Despite the uncertainty on commodity markets, the price of gold -- a safe haven -- lost its shine over the past week, hurt by a rally in the US dollar.The precious metal also lost its lure as a haven at as volatile Chinese markets took a holiday on Thursday and Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.On the London Bullion Market, gold was trading at $1,118.25 dollars an ounce Friday against $1.135 dollars a week before.

Qatargas Pakistan LNG supply deal details,"CAIRO/ISLAMABAD: State-run Gulf energy company Qatargas is in the final stages of talks on a deal to supply Pakistan with 3 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) annually for 15 years, industry sources in Doha told Reuters on Wednesday.The deal would help the country tackle serious energy shortages and power cuts which can last up to 20 hours a day. Nearly half the countrys electricity is generated by gas and its output of 4.1 billion cubic feet per day is well short of demand for as much as 6 billion, depending on the time of year.One source said the deal would be signed in weeks, while a second said the first shipment would be received by March.An official at the Ministry of Water and Power confirmed an LNG deal was planned but declined to give details. No-one at Qatargas, the world´s largest LNG producer, was available to comment.Pakistan State Oil (PSO) said payments to Qatar would be guaranteed by the government so any cash flow problems at PSO would not affect the Qatargas deal.

Greece bailout extension impact on Asian markets,"Hong Kong: Asian markets rallied and the euro held up Wednesday on hopes of a settlement in Greece´s debt stand-off after it emerged that the country will ask for an extension to its bailout and avoid a painful eurozone exit.Another record close on Wall Street also provided support, although trade was thin with some markets closed and others winding down for the Lunar New Year holiday.Tokyo rose 0.84 percent, Hong Kong added 0.21 percent, Sydney put on 0.61 percent and Singapore was 0.41 percent higher.Shanghai, Seoul and Taipei were closed for public holidays.Greek public television said Tuesday that the new government will apply for further aid from its European partners, although will not sign up to the painful austerity measures imposed on the country.And in an interview with German public broadcaster ZDF Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said: ""We should extend the credit programme by a few months to have enough stability so that we can negotiate a new agreement between Greece and Europe.""The news will come as a relief after two eurozone finance ministers´ meetings in the past week both collapsed without agreement as Athens refused to continue with the bailout that imposed swingeing spending cuts and tax hikes.The apparent change of face also comes days before its financial lifeline package expires, which would leave the country without any cash and unable to pay its bills, leading it to default and almost certainly leave the eurozone.Investors bought up the euro on the reports and it held the gains in Asia. The single currency fetched $1.1404 and 136.02 yen Wednesday, slightly down from $1.1413 and 136.13 yen in New York afternoon but well above the $1.1357 and 134.70 yen quoted in Tokyo earlier Tuesday.The dollar fetched 119.29 yen from 119.29 yen in New York and 118.55 yen in Tokyo on Tuesday.US shares resumed their record-breaking run Tuesday after they were closed Monday for a public holiday.The S&P 500 climbed 0.16 percent to a second straight all-time high, while the Dow added 0.16 percent.

ewarticle Hong Kong: The euro extended its gains against the dollar Tuesday while Asian equities climbed on hopes Greece´s new government will be able to negotiate a bailout deal with the EU and IMF that will avoid it leaving the eurozone.Regional investors took their lead from advances in Europe and New York, where news of Sunday´s Greek election win for anti-austerity party Syriza had been largely factored in, analysts said.Tokyo jumped 1.44 percent by lunch, Sydney added 0.67 percent, Shanghai edged up 0.10 percent, Seoul rose 0.46 percent and Hong Kong was flat.Markets have been buoyed by rhetoric coming out of Athens and its creditors that raises hopes they two sides can reach an agreement over Greece´s repayment of its 240-billion-euro bailout.Syriza had campaigned on renegotiating terms of the lifeline -- which included swingeing spending cuts and painful tax hikes -- and there are concerns it will default on its repayments, leading to its possible exit from the eurozone.But International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said she was prepared to continue its financial support to the country, while some European finance ministers suggested they were willing to talk, as long as Syriza did not demand its debt be wiped out.The messages coming out of Europe helped shares higher. In Europe, equities in London, Paris and Germany all closed with healthy gains, although Athens lost more than three percent.Dow edged 0.03 percent higher, the S&P 500 added 0.26 percent and the Nasdaq put on 0.29 percent.""The Greek elections had the potential to unnerve the market,"" Nader Naeimi, at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.""It´s quite encouraging that the new government and the EU are willing to negotiate. The market is in a risk-on mode.""The euro plunged to as low as $1.1098 at one point in Asia Monday, the lowest level since September 2003, before recovering later in the day to close out in New York at $1.1234.On Tuesday in Asia it bought $1.1250.It also sank to 131.55 yen Monday in Asia before bouncing to end the day at 133.12 yen. It bought 133.31 yen in Tokyo Tuesday.The dollar edged up to 118.47 yen from 118.49 yen in US trade.Oil prices edged up slightly after falling to fresh six-year lows Monday, despite a warning from the OPEC cartel that prices could punch $200 owing to shrinking investment in exploration.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for March delivery rose five cents to $45.20 while Brent crude for March gained 13 cents to $48.29.Gold fetched $1,276.39 an ounce, against $1,281.39 late Monday.

The single currency bought $1.0733 and 128.20 yen against $1.0741 and 128.05 yen on Wall Street.Hong Kong and Shanghai resumed their upward trend after sharp losses Monday that came after China´s stock market regulator tightened rules on trading with borrowed money and increase the supply of shares for short-selling.Confidence was buoyed by Sunday´s cut by the People´s Bank of China in the amount of cash lenders must hold in reserve, the move aimed at helping kick-start the economy, which grew in January-March at its slowest quarterly pace in six years. The next indicator on the state of China´s economy comes with HSBC´s preliminary index of manufacturing activity on Thursday.US traders welcomed that move. The Dow jumped 1.17 percent, the S&P 500 rose 0.92 percent and the Nasdaq rallied 1.27 percent.The dollar edged up despite a key Federal Reserve official suggesting a US rate hike could be put back.New York Fed President William C. Dudley said recent inflation data was not strong enough to warrant an increase, even though economics growth was healthy.The dollar was at 119.34 yen against 119.22 yen, and sharply higher than 118.62 yen in Tokyo earlier Monday.Oil prices retreated. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for May delivery fell 15 cents to $56.23 while Brent crude for June dipped 15 cents to $63.30.Gold fetched $1,194.55 against $1,200.30 late Monday.

current US crude oil inventory levels,"strong>LONDON: Oil prices rose towards $52 a barrel on Wednesday, hitting their highest level since June, supported by an industry report that U.S. inventories probably fell for a fifth straight week and OPEC's supply cut deal.</strongThe American Petroleum Institute (API) said on Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories dropped 7.6 million barrels, which would be the fifth straight weekly decline if confirmed by U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data on Wednesday.Brent crude was trading at $51.70 a barrel, up 83 cents, at 0819 GMT. The global benchmark touched $51.72 during the session, its highest since June 10. U.S. crude was up 75 cents at $49.44.Analysts are expecting a rise in crude stocks of 2.6 million barrels.But another drop in U.S. crude stocks would reinforce the view that the supply glut that has been weighing on prices since 2014 is easing. The API data, however, does not always tally with the EIA data, which is due at 1430 GMT.""All eyes now turn to the EIA crude inventory numbers,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA in Singapore, adding that another confirmed drawdown in crude stocks would likely push U.S. crude prices above $50.Brent has risen from below $49 on Sept. 28, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed a surprise cut in its output to support prices which are less than half the level of mid-2014.Under the deal, OPEC will target production of between 32.50 million barrels per day (bpd) and 33.0 million bpd, implying a cut of as much as 740,000 bpd from the August level, as reported in OPEC's monthly report.The move marked an about-face by OPEC, which in November 2014 dropped its role of cutting production. Although it hasn't yet worked out all the details, and analysts are skeptical the cut will be implemented, the deal is supporting the market.""The mere threat of a production cut should put a floor under oil prices until the next OPEC meeting on Nov. 30,"" said Jason Gammel of U.S. investment bank Jefferies. 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices rose in early Asian trade on Friday shrugging off a second consecutive week of U.S. crude oil inventory builds, with a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report late on Thursday indicating an unexpected rise in crude stocks.</strongU.S. benchmark West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 18 cents or 0.33 percent to $53.95 at 0105 GMT after settling 29 cents lower at $53.77 per barrel in the previous session.Brent front-month March crude oil futures were 12 cents a barrel or 0.21 percent higher at $56.97.Crude inventories were up 614,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 23, the EIA data showed, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 2.1 million barrel.Despite the unexpected rise in crude stocks, the EIA data published on Thursday showed a significantly smaller rise in crude stocks compared with Wednesday's American Petroleum Institute (API) data that indicated a 4.2 million barrel build in U.S. crude oil stocks in the same period.""Today's Department of Energy report was positive for light products due to draws in gasoline and distillate inventories compared to consensus' build expectations,"" British bank Barclays said in a note.Gasoline stocks fell 1.6 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.3 million-barrel rise.The market is likely to have focussed on the surprise draw in product stocks and taken on a slightly more bullish view towards the WTI contract, traders said.Oil prices will gradually rise towards $60 per barrel by the end of 2017, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, with further upside capped by a strong dollar, a likely recovery in U.S. oil output and possible non-compliance by OPEC with agreed cuts. 
ewarticle London: World oil prices rose Thursday on the back of the weaker dollar, but gains were capped after US crude reserves swelled again to a record high.In midday London deals, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery advanced 82 cents to $58.36 a barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April added 52 cents to $48.69 a barrel.""Despite the bearish oil inventories report yesterday, crude oil prices rebounded in early trade this morning supported by a slightly softer US dollar,"" said Sucden brokers analyst Myrto Sokou on Thursday.""Brent futures recovered and climbed higher towards $59 per barrel while WTI futures rose above $48.50 per barrel.""The weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated crude cheaper for buyers using stronger currencies, which tends to stimulate demand and prices.Crude futures had finished mixed Wednesday after a key report showed US crude stockpiles had struck another record high, adding to an oversupplied global market.The US Department of Energy said crude oil inventories surged by 4.5 million barrels in the week to March 6 to 448.9 million.That was the highest level since the beginning of the weekly data series in 1982.Crude prices lost some 60 percent of their value to decline to about $40 between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and the strong dollar.Prices have since rebounded somewhat following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.Elsewhere, investors were monitoring the progress of talks between the United States and other major Western powers and Iran on Tehran´s contested nuclear programme as a deadline at the end of March nears.The Islamic republic has been crippled by a series of UN and US sanctions, including on crude exports, aimed at bringing an end to its nuclear drive, which the West says is being used to develop atomic weapons. Iran denies the allegations.""Prices are likely to remain in a tight range for the next two weeks until the market gets more clarity on the ongoing negotiations between Iran and the US over the lifting of sanctions,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy EY.

""We got quite a bit ahead of ourselves here."" Smith said it is likely still too soon for the lower US rig count to meaningfully dent supply.""Yes, there are a couple of data points, but that doesn´t mean the US is not overflowing crude,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Paris-based International Energy Agency cut its supply forecast for non-OPEC countries, citing a lower outlook for US and Canadian production and the ""worsening conflict"" in Yemen.The agency also bumped up by 90,000 barrels per day its forecast for 2015 petroleum demand. The IEA now expects 2015 consumption of 93.6 million barrels per day, up 1.1 million barrels per day for the year. (AFP)

ewarticle strong>NEW DELHI/MUMBAI:  Apple Inc chief Tim Cook met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, concluding a four-day trip to India that could set the stage for Apple´s expansion plans in one of the world´s fastest growing smartphone markets.</strongModi and Cook met for an hour in central Delhi and discussed Apple´s plans for its India business, including the possibility of manufacturing and retailing in the country.Apple is looking to expand its retail presence in India and is pursuing a license to set up its own stores, which could start to open as early as next year.Government officials say India is keen to get Apple to start making products in the country in what would be a boost for Modi´s ""Make in India"" manufacturing push.""Every aspect of business was discussed. Now it´s for Apple to talk about their plans,"" a close aide of Modi said.Cook´s first official visit to the country comes at a crucial time as Apple looks for new growth markets after posting its first-ever decline in iPhone sales.More than 100 million smartphones were sold in India last year and sales are expected to grow 25 percent this year, but Apple only has about a 2 percent share of the market.The company has been pushing the Indian government to allow it to import refurbished phones in the country, but that application was turned down earlier this month.A second source aware of the meeting said Cook asked Modi to reconsider the company´s plans to import refurbished phones  a strategy seen key for Apple to make affordable iPhones available in a country where most smartphone sell for less than $150.In an interview with NDTV channel on Friday, Cook said Apple plans to import second hand phones and refurbish them at a facility in India.Cook spent most of the week meeting heads of India´s largest companies, including telecom operator Bharti Airtel  and lender ICICI Bank, but also took out time to visit a temple, dine with Bollywood stars and watch cricket.Apple also announced plans to expand a software development centre it recently opened in Hyderebad and launched a program  for local developers working on its iOS platform.Modi and Cook also discussed cyber-security and data encryption, a government statement said.Apple has been at the centre of a debate on the role technology companies play in protecting data that led to a much-publicised dispute between Apple and the FBI over a phone linked to a shooting in San Bernardino, California.

ewarticle BEIJING: Automakers in China face a war of attrition in the market for environmentally friendly cars as tighter regulations force heavy spending on development and production while a slowing economy leaves the demand outlook hazy.Top vehicle manufacturers from around the world laid out plans for new green offerings at an auto show that kicked off here Monday -- a massive event featuring more than 1,600 companies and nearly 1,200 new models.Volkswagen, still struggling to recover from an emissions scandal, was in the spotlight early on. It will invest more than 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in 2016 alone in such areas as environmental and safety technology, said Jochem Heizmann, who heads the German company's operations here.China is VW's most important market. With the government planning to adopt the world's toughest emissions regulations in 2017, the automaker intends to roll out 15 eco-car models over the next three to four years. It will begin full-scale production of a plug-in hybrid based on the Golf around 2018.Toyota Motor plans to build a plug-in-hybrid version of the Corolla starting that year. The company arranged the rollout schedule to coincide with a number of planned launches of plug-in hybrids by other automakers, said Hiroji Onishi, head of China operations.Honda Motor  will begin production of an Accord hybrid this July and release a plug-in hybrid in 2020. Market leader General Motors plans to spend 100 billion yuan ($15.3 billion) over the next five years to promote sales of electric and other vehicles.China led the world in new-car sales for a seventh straight year in 2015, at 24.59 million vehicles. Even if market growth slows, many still see plenty of room for expansion, given that the country has just over one car for every 10 people. Automakers are scrambling to roll out new models to take advantage of generous subsidies for eco-car purchases.But ""demand is strong now because of the tax break on compact cars that started last October,"" said Nobuhiko Watabe, an executive officer at Mazda Motor, adding that the true state of affairs is dire. Automakers' margins are narrowing as price wars become the norm on sales floors.

Current trends in WTI and Brent crude oil prices,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices rose in Asian trade on Friday, setting crude futures on course for one of their biggest weekly gains this year, as sentiment has become more upbeat despite ongoing oversupply.</strongInternational benchmark Brent crude futures were trading at $45.09 per barrel at 0054 GMT, up more than half a<br/>dollar from their last settlement.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 52 cents at $43.70 a barrel. With Brent up 8 percent since Monday and WTI 12 percent higher since April 18, this week is set for some of the steepest price rallies so far this year, and crude is up by more than two-thirds since its 2016 lows between January and February.Traders said that sentiment in the entire commodity complex had turned more confident, with new cash being put into the market by investors, lifting prices.Another factor has been producers taking advantage of higher prices by locking in production. ""We would expect producers in the U.S. taking every opportunity to aggressively hedge as soon as there is opportunity when oil prices recover for short periods of time,"" French investment bank Natixis said.Falling output, especially in the United States, where many producers are shutting down following an up to 70 percent price<br/>rout since 2014, is also helping to lift the market.Natixis said it expected U.S. oil production to drop by at least 500,000 to 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, compared with 2015, and by another 500,000 bpd in 2017.Despite the recent rally, oil markets remain oversupplied as<br/>between 1 and 2 million barrels of crude are being pumped out of the ground every day in excess of demand, leaving storage tanks around the world filled to the rims with unsold fuel. 
ewarticle London: World oil prices rose Thursday on the back of the weaker dollar, but gains were capped after US crude reserves swelled again to a record high.In midday London deals, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery advanced 82 cents to $58.36 a barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April added 52 cents to $48.69 a barrel.""Despite the bearish oil inventories report yesterday, crude oil prices rebounded in early trade this morning supported by a slightly softer US dollar,"" said Sucden brokers analyst Myrto Sokou on Thursday.""Brent futures recovered and climbed higher towards $59 per barrel while WTI futures rose above $48.50 per barrel.""The weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated crude cheaper for buyers using stronger currencies, which tends to stimulate demand and prices.Crude futures had finished mixed Wednesday after a key report showed US crude stockpiles had struck another record high, adding to an oversupplied global market.The US Department of Energy said crude oil inventories surged by 4.5 million barrels in the week to March 6 to 448.9 million.That was the highest level since the beginning of the weekly data series in 1982.Crude prices lost some 60 percent of their value to decline to about $40 between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and the strong dollar.Prices have since rebounded somewhat following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.Elsewhere, investors were monitoring the progress of talks between the United States and other major Western powers and Iran on Tehran´s contested nuclear programme as a deadline at the end of March nears.The Islamic republic has been crippled by a series of UN and US sanctions, including on crude exports, aimed at bringing an end to its nuclear drive, which the West says is being used to develop atomic weapons. Iran denies the allegations.""Prices are likely to remain in a tight range for the next two weeks until the market gets more clarity on the ongoing negotiations between Iran and the US over the lifting of sanctions,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy EY.

ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices slid on Thursday as record U.S. crude inventories at the Cushing delivery point and worries about a global economic slowdown weighed on markets, and Goldman Sachs said prices would remain low and volatile until the second half of the year.</strongInternational benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 were trading at $30.67 per barrel at 0601 GMT, down 17 cents.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were at $27.01 per barrel, down 44 cents and within a dollar of the $26.19 a barrel intra-day low hit in January that was the lowest since 2003.Inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for U.S. crude futures rose to an all-time high just shy of 65 million barrels, data from the government's Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed on Wednesday.The U.S.-based Schork Report said that seasonally falling crude oil demand towards the end of the winter heating season also weighed on markets.Analysts said that the recent strength in Brent's premium over WTI contracts was supported by U.S. slowing demand and brimming storage.""Brent is holding much stronger than WTI which reflects the current oversupply in the U.S.,"" said Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures.The overhang in oil supplies, together with an economic slowdown in China, means that prices will remain low until the second half of the year, Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.""The risks of China growth concerns and oil price downside ... materialised faster than we anticipated,"" the bank said.""We expect oil prices will continue to fluctuate between $20 per barrel (operational stress level) and $40 per barrel (financial stress level) with significant volatility and no price trend until 2H2016,"" it added.Chart analysts said that crude prices may be just days away from falling to $25 a barrel or below as weakening technicals put more pressure on the market.Matthew Sferro, technical analyst at New York's Informa Global Markets, said if WTI fell further it would likely test the support level at $25.04 per barrel established in April 2003.Oil prices have fallen almost 75 percent since mid-2014 as producers pump 1-2 million barrels of crude every day in excess of demand, just as China's economy grows at its lowest rate in a generation.Trading activity in Asia remained low due to China's New Year holiday which lasts all week and as Japan is also on a public holiday. 
ewarticle London: Global oil prices slid Wednesday following a three-day rally as dealers were divided on whether the commodity has bottomed out after a plunge of nearly 60 percent since June. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in March shed $1.72 to stand at $51.33 a barrel compared with Tuesday´s close.Brent North Sea crude for March slid $1.15 a barrel to trade at $56.76 in London afternoon trade.WTI had soared $3.48 Tuesday to record its highest finish since December 31, while Brent jumped $3.16 to a similar closing peak, as dealers cheered signs that the oil industry is tightening exploration activities to cap a supply glut.Ken Hasegawa, an energy trading manager at Newedge Group in Tokyo, said the crude market was ""extremely volatile"" after the three-day rally that began Friday saw prices surge nearly 20 percent.""It has become increasingly difficult to discern the direction of the prices of crude oil, but the fundamentals remain unchanged,"" Hasegawa told AFP. He added that prices could ""fluctuate by increasing up to $10 and falling up to $10"" in the short term.Deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies, including new announcements Tuesday by BP and BG Group, had suggested there would be tighter supplies in the future. The Baker Hughes North America rig count report for the week to January 30 showed a drop of 128 rigs to 1,937. That compared with 2,393 a year ago.Some analysts however remain doubtful that the current oil price rebound will be sustained as supplies still outweigh demand in the immediate term.The oil market has lost more than half its value since June largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale oil production. The problem was exacerbated in November after OPEC decided to maintain output levels despite plunging prices.The 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel pumps about 30 percent of global crude supplies.

To a question he said that Pakistan has been facing crisis of energy for several years due to which not only domestic users are facing troubles but economy of the country has been affected badly.In his comment former General Manager Sui Southern Gas Brigadier (R) Agha Gul also said that the process of buying LNG from Qatar was going on from 2004. Talking to VOA he said God willing this will prove to be one of the achievements Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has secured so far.He said people who have some know how of the energy crisis will term this project as light at the end of the tunnel.Agha Gul said the government has made the deal at the time when petrol prices have reduced which will have a good impact on the deal.He said the deal will help in reducing power load-shedding by 10 to 15 percent.

Traders may increase the export of sugar to make profit,"" Paswan tweeted on Thursday evening.Traders and experts said the new tax could push up global sugar prices, even though India was already expected to become a net importer in the year from Oct. 1 following back-to-back drought years.""Since we are the world's second largest sugar producer there could be a 5 percent impact on global prices but not more,"" said Aurobinda Prasad, vice president research, Kotak Commodities.India exported 2.9 million tonnes of sugar in 2015/16, accounting for 5.3 percent of world exports, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) figures.In a May report, the USDA already forecast sharply reduced exports from India this year of just 1 million tonnes, which would be the lowest since the 2009/10 crop year.""With rising white sugar prices and the weakening rupee, Indian mills could have signed export deals with Sri Lanka. That won't happen now,"" said a Singapore-based trader.Global sugar prices have also been buoyed by cold temperatures in parts of Brazil and growing demand.""Markets were not expecting exports from India but the move to tax sugar exports will definitely have a temporary impact on global prices,"" said a Delhi-based sugar industry expert.He said the plan to tax exports is better than the country's previous moves to ban overseas sales.The move would help rival exporters Thailand and Brazil, said a Mumbai-based trader.""Thailand will benefit more since it has been competing with India in the white sugar market. It also has freight advantages in catering to Asian consumers,"" the trader said.

Current trends in oil prices and factors influencing them,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices remained near 2016 highs in early trading on Thursday, buoyed by a fall in U.S. crude inventories, a weaker dollar and strong demand, but some analysts warned that the recent rally was starting to look overblown.</strongInternational Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were trading at $52.70 per barrel at 0045 GMT, up 19 cents from their last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was 32 cents higher at $51.55 a barrel.Traders said the price rises were largely a result of a drop in U.S. crude oil inventories.Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. crude stocks last week fell by 3.23 million barrels to 532.5 million barrels, marking their third consecutive weekly fall.A weaker dollar, down around 2.4 percent this month against a basket of other currencies, makes dollar-traded fuel imports for countries using other currencies cheaper, also supporting oil prices, traders said.But some analysts said there were also signs that the recent oil price rise, which saw Brent rally 6 percent this month and prices virtually double since February to one-year highs, may be overblown.ANZ bank said that price rises were ""tempered by an increase in crude production of 10,000 barrels per day to 8.75 million barrels per day and the number of active rigs increasing by 9 to 325"".Traders also warned of an ongoing build in refined product stocks in the United States and Asia.With fundamentals weighing both for and against higher prices, many traders and analysts say that a price tag of $50-60 for a barrel of crude was a fair value for oil, reflected in Brent's forward curve which stays within that range until early 2021. 
ewarticle KARACHI: The price of petroleum products are expected to increase in June, industry sources have revealed to Geo News. The per litre price of diesel may rise by Rs6.20 and petrol by Rs5.80.  A staggering Rs11 increase may be seen in the price of HOBC. The reason for the price increase is the turmoil in Yemen which has led to an increase in crude oil price in the international market.  










 
ewarticle London: Oil prices nudged higher on Friday, further recovering from a steep dive seen mid-week, although demand is set to remain shackled by a global supply glut, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in May edged up one cent to $50.80 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for May gained 27 cents to $56.84 around midday in London.WTI and Brent sank 3.6 percent on Wednesday after the US Department of Energy said commercial inventories in the world´s biggest economy hit a record high last week.That came after Saudi Arabia´s Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said his country´s production had hit an all-time high of 10.3 million barrels a day in March.Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group, has said this week that rising imports of US crude oil could indicate improved demand prospects in the world´s largest oil consumer or concerns about supply tightening.Price support has meanwhile come from events concerning major oil producer Iran.Analysts attributed steep gains at the start of the week to investors concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.The United States on Thursday warned that sanctions on Iran will be lifted in stages as a nuclear deal is implemented, after Tehran demanded they be removed as soon as it comes into force.""Geopolitical factors remain a constant worry for investors with concerns regarding Iran´s nuclear programme potentially leading to ongoing volatility in the crude oil market,"" said Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokerage.

ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices dipped in early Asian trade on Monday as rising production in the Middle East outweighed falling US output and the recent slide in the dollar, which has been supporting crude.</strongBrent futures were trading at $47.05 (32 pounds) per barrel at 0028 GMT on Monday, down 32 cents from their last settlement. US crude was down 28 cents at $45.64 a barrel.Analysts said rising output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and especially the Middle East was outweighing supportive factors such as an ongoing, albeit slow, fall in U.S. output and a sliding dollar, which makes it cheaper for countries using other currencies to import dollar-traded fuel.""The weaker dollar failed to excite investors in the crude oil markets,"" ANZ bank said, citing a rise in OPEC-output as the main downward driver for prices.The dollar has fallen over 6 percent this year against a basket of other leading currencies.French bank BNP Paribas said that a recent oil rally, with prices jumping almost a third since April, was largely driven by sentiment and lacked physical fundamentals.""The recent rally in oil prices ... appears to have little to do with fundamentals,"" it said.""We see the recent rally as sowing the seeds of its own demise, and extending our recommendation to protect against short-term downside risk.""OPEC-supplies rose to 32.64 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, from 32.47 million bpd in March, according to a Reuters survey based on shipping data and information from sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.That almost matches January's 32.65 million bpd, when Indonesia's return to OPEC boosted production to records.Despite Monday's lower prices, other analysts are growing confident that a near-two-year rout in oil has ended, and many have raised their price forecasts.The chief of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil prices may have bottomed out, providing the health of the global economy does not pose a concern.""In a normal economic environment, we will see the price direction is rather upwards than downwards,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Sunday.Non-OPEC output is set to fall by more than 700,000 bpd this year, the biggest decline in around 20 years, he said.With global oil demand seen growing by 1.2 million bpd this year, the draw in global stockpiles will start soon, helping push up prices, he said. 
ewarticle London: Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as the market seeks to build on strong gains in April following massive falls earlier in the year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in June won 56 cents to $59.49 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for June won 47 cents to stand at $66.93 a barrel in London midday deals.After slumping at the start of the year, oil prices rose by about a fifth in value during April owing to several factors including concerns about unrest in Yemen, the weakening dollar and fewer US rigs in operation, analysts said.However, prices remain well down after plunging almost 60 percent between June and the start of 2015 on the back of a global supply glut and ramped up production.""Crude oil producers in the US have significantly cut back output in an attempt to address the significant supply overhang which has exerted downward pressure on... prices since June last year,"" Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokers said on Tuesday.The International Monetary Fund has said that Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.""Saudi Arabia seem committed to defending their market share and have even increased output to over 10 million barrels per day in April,"" said Kamal.""Support for higher crude prices has partly come from a weaker dollar,"" he added.A weaker dollar makes oil priced in the US unit cheaper for holders of others currencies, boosting demand.

Current trends in oil prices and US crude inventory levels,"strong>LONDON: Oil prices rose towards $52 a barrel on Wednesday, hitting their highest level since June, supported by an industry report that U.S. inventories probably fell for a fifth straight week and OPEC's supply cut deal.</strongThe American Petroleum Institute (API) said on Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories dropped 7.6 million barrels, which would be the fifth straight weekly decline if confirmed by U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data on Wednesday.Brent crude was trading at $51.70 a barrel, up 83 cents, at 0819 GMT. The global benchmark touched $51.72 during the session, its highest since June 10. U.S. crude was up 75 cents at $49.44.Analysts are expecting a rise in crude stocks of 2.6 million barrels.But another drop in U.S. crude stocks would reinforce the view that the supply glut that has been weighing on prices since 2014 is easing. The API data, however, does not always tally with the EIA data, which is due at 1430 GMT.""All eyes now turn to the EIA crude inventory numbers,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA in Singapore, adding that another confirmed drawdown in crude stocks would likely push U.S. crude prices above $50.Brent has risen from below $49 on Sept. 28, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed a surprise cut in its output to support prices which are less than half the level of mid-2014.Under the deal, OPEC will target production of between 32.50 million barrels per day (bpd) and 33.0 million bpd, implying a cut of as much as 740,000 bpd from the August level, as reported in OPEC's monthly report.The move marked an about-face by OPEC, which in November 2014 dropped its role of cutting production. Although it hasn't yet worked out all the details, and analysts are skeptical the cut will be implemented, the deal is supporting the market.""The mere threat of a production cut should put a floor under oil prices until the next OPEC meeting on Nov. 30,"" said Jason Gammel of U.S. investment bank Jefferies.

What are the details of the KASA 1000 electricity transfer project between Tajikistan and Pakistan?,"ISLAMABAD: Ambassador of Tajikistan Sher Ali Jononov on Friday said that his country was preparing to export sizeable quantity of electricity to Pakistan to lessen the intensity of the energy crisis which has compromised economic growth. The KASA 1000 project is among the major electricity transfer projects in the region, based on which 1,300 megawatts of electricity from Kazakhstan and Tajikistan is expected to be transferred to Afghanistan and Pakistan.He said that Tajikistan wished to enhance bilateral trade with Pakistan and invited the business community to visit his country to explore investment opportunities and organise trade exhibitions. He added that the energy sector of Tajikistan had been showing sustainable growth for the last 15 years transforming the country into the worlds third largest producer of hydroelectric power after the US and Russia. Jononov went on to say that hydroelectric generation accounted for 76 percent of the total energy output of the country and the total cost of the project which would lighten Pakistan through Tajik electricity will be financed by the World Bank, ADB, Islamic Development Bank and other donors.He also said that this project would not only alleviate electricity shortages in Pakistan but would also replace fuel based electricity generation for Afghanistan and Pakistan, adding that it would also establish Afghanistan as a viable transit country and offer transmission capacity for other countries during the off peak season.He further said that it would also create a viable governance mechanism to build confidence among neighbours as major share of the export will be used by Pakistan and approximately 300 MW will be utilised by Afghanistan. 










 
ewarticle strong>ISLAMABAD: State Grid of China will help build a 4,000 MW power transmission line in Pakistan in a project valued at $1.5 billion, Pakistan said on Friday, the latest in a series of Chinese investments in its South Asian neighbour.</strongThe high-capacity transmission line will be the first of its kind in Pakistan and will link Matiari town in the south, near a new power station, to Lahore city in the east, a key link in transmission infrastructure, the Pakistani government said.An agreement on the project was signed on Thursday in Beijing between Mohammad Younus Dagha, Pakistan's secretary of water and power, and Shu Yinbiao, chairman of State Grid Corporation of China, the government said in a statement.Construction will begin in January, and should take about 20 months, said a spokesman for the Pakistani prime minister's office.Pakistan has been plagued by a shortage of electricity for years, with widespread rolling blackouts in both rural and urban areas.The government has managed to reduce load shedding - scheduled power outages - in some areas, but production gaps and distribution woes remain.The project is the latest in a series of big Chinese investments, most of which fall under a planned $55 billion worth of projects for a China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The corridor is a combination of power and infrastructure projects that link western China to Pakistan's southern port of Gwadar.Other Chinese investment in Pakistan has included the acquisition of a majority stake by Shanghai Electric of the K-Electric power production and distribution company for $1.8 billion.Last week, a Chinese-led consortium bought a 40 percent stake of the Pakistan Stock Exchange for an estimated $85 million. 
ewarticle ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Water and Power Khawaja Asif on Wednesday said that despite the expiry of an agreement with the K-Electric, power is being supplied to it keeping in view the interest of people of the metropolis.Speaking to media representatives, he said that K-Electric has the capacity to generate sufficient power to meet the requirements of Karachi. However, it gets 650 MW of subsidised electricity from the national grid, he added. Asif said the issue will be reviewed in the new contract agreement with the K-Electric.The minister said the duration of loadshedding has been reduced across the country as compared to the previous year. Industries are being provided with uninterrupted electricity now, he added.To a question about the funding of Diamer Basha Dam, the power minister said the government will start construction on the project from its own resources. When asked about violations of Indus Water Treaty by India, Khawaja Asif said Pakistan is vigilant to the situation and will raise the matter at an appropriate forum in case of any violation.

ewarticle ISLAMABAD: Seven private coal-based and hydropower projects, having a total electricity generation capacity of 5,155 megawatts, will reach their financial close by yearend, a minister said on Thursday.Minister for Water and Power Khawaja Muhammad Asif, chairing 102nd meeting of the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB), said the implementation of these projects will start after the financial close.These projects have local and foreign investments. Investors from China, Korea, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have large equity contributions in these projects.The government is making every effort to increase electricity supply to the national grid through all possible avenues, private sector being one of them, Asif said.The said projects include 102MW Gulpur hydropower at Poonch River, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, 720MW Karot hydropower at Jhelum River, district Rawalpindi, 870 MW Suki Kinari hydropower at Kunhar River, Mansehra, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 1,320MW Port Qasim coal-based power, 660MW Engro Powergen coal-based power at Thar Block-II, Sindh, 1,320MW Shandong imported coal-based power at Qadirabad, Sahiwal, and 163MW Grange Holdings coal-based power at Arifwala, Punjab. The minister said the presence of international investment groups/companies in the development of private sector power projects shows the confidence of the international community in the governments policies. Various ongoing private power projects were also discussed during the meeting. The board was briefed on coal and hydel based private power generation projects being handled by PPIB, particularly the projects being processed under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The minister and board members expressed their satisfaction on the progress and advised PPIB to ensure the timely completion of the projects. 










"
current trends in global oil prices 2023,"London: Oil prices nudged higher on Friday, further recovering from a steep dive seen mid-week, although demand is set to remain shackled by a global supply glut, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in May edged up one cent to $50.80 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for May gained 27 cents to $56.84 around midday in London.WTI and Brent sank 3.6 percent on Wednesday after the US Department of Energy said commercial inventories in the world´s biggest economy hit a record high last week.That came after Saudi Arabia´s Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said his country´s production had hit an all-time high of 10.3 million barrels a day in March.Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group, has said this week that rising imports of US crude oil could indicate improved demand prospects in the world´s largest oil consumer or concerns about supply tightening.Price support has meanwhile come from events concerning major oil producer Iran.Analysts attributed steep gains at the start of the week to investors concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.The United States on Thursday warned that sanctions on Iran will be lifted in stages as a nuclear deal is implemented, after Tehran demanded they be removed as soon as it comes into force.""Geopolitical factors remain a constant worry for investors with concerns regarding Iran´s nuclear programme potentially leading to ongoing volatility in the crude oil market,"" said Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokerage.

ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices were stable in early trading on Monday, with global oversupply and slowing economic growth weighing on markets but prospects of falling production lending some support.</strongUS crude futures were trading at $38.41 per barrel at 0239 GMT, down 10 cents from their last settlement.But international Brent futures were up 6 cents at $40.45 a barrel.While Morgan Stanley said that oil prices had likely bottomed out, it warned that a slowing economy and high production would prevent sharp rises.""Oil prices now seem to have bottomed, even though they are likely to stay subdued for the rest of this year before starting to move higher in 2017,"" the US bank said, adding that cheap oil had not provided the economic boost to growth that many had hoped for.""When oil prices are falling below production costs, the income gains for consumers will be smaller than the costs to producers and falling oil prices become a negative-sum game,"" it said.For 2016, the bank said it was ""no longer looking for an acceleration in 2016 GDP growth"" and that the risk of a global recession was now 30 percent.Following a 70 percent price rout between mid-2014 and early 2016, oil markets are in flux.Many analysts expect a modest price recovery, while others see another slump.The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Friday said that oil prices had bottomed out due to US and other output cuts outside the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).The US rig count fell for a 12th straight week last week to a total of 386, its lowest since December 2009 as drillers continue to slash capital expenditure.Others, like Goldman Sachs, warn that ongoing global overproduction, which continues to see over 1 million barrels of crude produced in excess of demand every day, will pull prices back down again.So far, demand in core markets like China remains strong.China's January-February refinery throughput rose 4.6 percent compared to the same period a year earlier to 87.08 million tonnes (10.59 million barrels per day), official data showed on Saturday.The data release came shortly after China reported record daily crude imports of 8 million barrels per day.In traded markets, sentiment leans towards higher prices, with the amount of managed short positions open for US crude, which would profit from falling prices, down over 40 percent since mid-February, while the amount of trades betting on price increases stands near record highs.""The shift in sentiment in commodity markets continues to gather strength ... The worst may be over for commodity markets,"" ANZ bank said. 
ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices remained under pressure in Asia Friday after a huge jump in US crude inventories reinforced projections that a supply glut will persist well into next year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in December was down 24 cents to $41.51 and Brent crude for December was trading four cents higher at $44.10 a barrel at around 0330 GMT.Prices were hammered Thursday after the US Department of Energy reported that commercial crude inventories in the world´s top oil consumer grew by 4.2 million barrels last week, far higher than analyst expectations of an increase of 1.3 million barrels.WTI sank 2.7 percent and Brent fell 3.8 percent after the report, which also showed US crude oil production continued to ramp higher.Global oil demand growth has not been fast enough to soak up the excess in supplies and analysts say a rebalancing of the supply-demand situation is needed for a sustained uptick in prices.Oil prices have plunged by more than half from peaks of over $100 a barrel in mid-2014.""Although global oil demand growth has been exceptionally strong year-to-date, the overall pace of supply side adjustment has been too slow to end a sustained increase in global inventories that we expect to persist through most of 2016,"" British bank Barclays said.It said in a market commentary that US offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico reached its highest level since early 2010 in August and is expected to remain strong although at a slower pace into 2016 ""as several more new fields begin to produce"".Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have also kept production high in an aggressive bid to retain market share.OPEC´s collective production has stabilised at around 31.5 million barrels per day in recent months, Barclays said, but this is still more than its output ceiling of 30 million barrels per day. 










 
ewarticle strong>LONDON: Oil edged above $50 a barrel on Thursday, drawing support from sources' comments that OPEC's Gulf members are willing to cut their output by 4 percent and from a further drop in U.S. crude inventories.</strongSaudi Arabia and its Gulf OPEC allies are willing to make that reduction from their peak oil output, energy ministers from the Gulf countries told their Russian counterpart this week, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.""That seems to be the reason behind the price move,"" said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank. ""But the big question is, how will they handle Iraq.""Brent crude was up 38 cents at $50.36 a barrel as of 1348 GMT, having risen as high as $50.67 intra-day. U.S. crude gained 28 cents to $49.46.Oil also drew support from the unexpected drop in U.S. crude inventories, and larger than expected falls in stocks of gasoline and distillates, reported this week, which raised hopes that a long-awaited market rebalancing is finally under way.""The global stock overhang must be reduced in order to see higher prices. Whilst such reduction is largely in the hand of OPEC, the re-balancing is already taking place in the U.S.,"" Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM said.The market was keeping an eye on escalating protests in Venezuela against the rule of President Nicolas Maduro, although there was no sign of any impact on the OPEC member's oil output. Venezuelan production has been falling this year as low prices hit investment.Doubts about the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' supply cut deal have been weighing on the market this week.OPEC agreed last month its first deal to restrain output in eight years to boost prices. But Iraq on Sunday called for Baghdad to be exempt, adding to the list of members seeking special treatment.A technical meeting at OPEC's headquarters on Friday, and with officials from non-OPEC countries on Saturday, is supposed to come up with recommendations on how to implement the supply cutback to the oil ministers' next meeting on Nov. 30.The OPEC plan is designed to speed up the removal of a supply glut that is keeping oil prices at less than half their level of mid-2014, cutting exporters' income and leading to investment cuts by oil companies worldwide. 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices dipped in early Asian trade on Monday as rising production in the Middle East outweighed falling US output and the recent slide in the dollar, which has been supporting crude.</strongBrent futures were trading at $47.05 (32 pounds) per barrel at 0028 GMT on Monday, down 32 cents from their last settlement. US crude was down 28 cents at $45.64 a barrel.Analysts said rising output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and especially the Middle East was outweighing supportive factors such as an ongoing, albeit slow, fall in U.S. output and a sliding dollar, which makes it cheaper for countries using other currencies to import dollar-traded fuel.""The weaker dollar failed to excite investors in the crude oil markets,"" ANZ bank said, citing a rise in OPEC-output as the main downward driver for prices.The dollar has fallen over 6 percent this year against a basket of other leading currencies.French bank BNP Paribas said that a recent oil rally, with prices jumping almost a third since April, was largely driven by sentiment and lacked physical fundamentals.""The recent rally in oil prices ... appears to have little to do with fundamentals,"" it said.""We see the recent rally as sowing the seeds of its own demise, and extending our recommendation to protect against short-term downside risk.""OPEC-supplies rose to 32.64 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, from 32.47 million bpd in March, according to a Reuters survey based on shipping data and information from sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.That almost matches January's 32.65 million bpd, when Indonesia's return to OPEC boosted production to records.Despite Monday's lower prices, other analysts are growing confident that a near-two-year rout in oil has ended, and many have raised their price forecasts.The chief of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil prices may have bottomed out, providing the health of the global economy does not pose a concern.""In a normal economic environment, we will see the price direction is rather upwards than downwards,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Sunday.Non-OPEC output is set to fall by more than 700,000 bpd this year, the biggest decline in around 20 years, he said.With global oil demand seen growing by 1.2 million bpd this year, the draw in global stockpiles will start soon, helping push up prices, he said."
What was the impact of China's central bank interest rate cut on Hong Kong stocks?,"Hong Kong: Asian stocks flip-flopped on Wednesday after China cut interest rates in a bid to restore confidence in its sagging economy, with trading volatile after days of heavy swings across world equities.The dollar edged up in Tokyo, after rebounding from this week´s steep losses in New York as nervous investors searched for safety.Tokyo rose 0.40 percent by the break, bouncing after their worst two-day plunge since 2011, and Seoul added 1.05 percent as China´s move to cut rates and free up cash for banks to lend spurred optimism.But Shanghai swiftly gave up gains in opening deals to fall 3.03 percent by mid-morning, and Hong Kong and Sydney both dropped 0.70 percent.China on Tuesday cut its key interest rate and slashed the amount of money banks must hold in reserve for the second time in as many months in a bid to spur growth and end its worst stock market rout in decades.The People´s Bank of China has already cut interest rates five times since November to spur the slowing economy as concerns mount it may miss its seven percent growth target for the year.Fears of stalling growth in China, the world´s number two economy and key driver of world growth, has sent global markets into a tailspin and investors said the cuts alone may not be enough to stem the losses.""The authorities have not been intervening, they have been allowing stocks to go down in price. Assuming that continues to be the case on Wednesday, I do see a continued fall in prices,"" Komal Sri-Kumar, founder of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, told Bloomberg News.In currency trade, the dollar remained under pressure at 118.96 yen, little changed from 118.84 yen in New York trade Tuesday, but dramatically weaker than the 122.06 yen seen in US trade on Friday.The euro stood at $1.1535 and 137.25 yen in Tokyo, compared with $1.1518 and 136.87 yen in New York overnight.Oil prices held steady ahead of the latest US energy report after heavy losses earlier in the week owing to jitters over China´s faltering economy.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery gained four cents to $39.35 while Brent crude for October rose 11 cents to $43.32.Gold traded at $1,137.66 compared to $1,149.80 late Tuesday.In individual shares, BHP Billiton rose 0.81 percent to Aus$23.54 after the global mining giant announced a 86.2 percent slump in annual net profit after trading closed Tuesday.

ewarticle Hong Kong: Asian shares were mixed Thursday, as an afternoon rally on Wall Street gave investors room to breathe after concerns about China´s economy jolted global financial markets.The dollar inched higher, after taking a knock in New York from speculation the US Federal Reserve will delay hiking interest rates following China´s devaluation of the yuan.Tokyo opened flat, easing 0.23 points, Sydney added 0.57 percent and Seoul dipped 0.1 percent after the South Korean central bank left its key rate at a record low.Hong Kong added 0.60 percent and Shanghai rose 0.19 percent in early deals.China cut the rate of the yuan against the dollar for the third consecutive day Thursday, reducing the reference rate by 1.1 percent from the previous session.The reduction comes after two previous cuts, on Tuesday and Wednesday, sparked concerns that China´s economy, long an engine for world growth, is weaker than previously thought.The move fanned fears the Chinese currency could be set for a prolonged depreciation and send shockwaves reverberating through global financial markets.Commodities along with stocks in Europe and Asia fell, safe-havens gold and bonds rose and currencies in Asia-Pacific suffered their worst two-day selloff since 1998.But an afternoon comeback on Wall Street, led by Apple and energy stocks, and news China´s central bank had intervened to stop the yuan tanking on Wednesday cheered dealers.The intervention ""is a hopeful sign that the authorities are not shooting for a maxi-devaluation,"" Tim Condon, head of Asian research at ING in Singapore, told Bloomberg News.In Tokyo forex trade, the dollar fetched 124.30 yen early Thursday against 124.24 yen in New York late Wednesday.The euro exchanged hands at $1.1156 and 138.67 yen compared with $1.1159 and 138.63 yen in US trade.Oil prices were mixed on Thursday after edging up from a six-year low in New York on news US oil supplies declined and the dollar retreated.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in September fell three cents to $43.27 and Brent crude for September rose five cents to $49.71 in morning Asian trade.Safe-haven gold fetched $1,121.23 compared to $1,117.50 late Wednesday.In individual shares, Australia´s Telstra fell two percent to Aus$6.12 after the telecoms company said annual net profit fell one percent Aus$4.23 billion after the sale of Hong Kong mobile business CSL.Chinese Internet giant Alibaba closed more than five percent lower in New York at $73.38 after a disappointing quarterly report showed sales growth cooling.

Consumers reported growing pessimism about current and short-term US economic conditions.A series of disappointing indicators has fuelled speculation the US central bank will want to wait to increase rates, which have been pegged at zero since 2008. The Fed had signalled a possible rise as early as June, but analysts now expect it in September at the earliest.Wednesday will also see the release of the government´s first estimate on first-quarter economic growth, with analysts forecasting 1.0 percent, down from a 2.2 percent pace in the previous three months.However, on Wall Street Tuesday the Dow added 0.40 percent and the S&P 500 rose 0.28 percent.

Who is the richest person according to Forbes latest ranking?,"NEW YORK: Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates kept his spot as the worlds richest man, a rank he has held for 16 of the past 21 years, Forbes magazine said Monday.The Microsoft co-founders fortune increased $3.2 billion since last year to $79.2 billion, the business magazine said, despite a $1.5 billion gift of Microsoft shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in November.Mexican telecom tycoon Carlos Slim held onto second place thanks to his $77.1 billion, ahead of American investor Warren Buffett, with $72.7 billion. The so-called Oracle of Omaha was the biggest gainer of the Forbes list this year, up $14.5 billion from last year riding on the rising share price of his Berkshire Hathaway.In fourth was Amancio Ortega, founder of the Inditex fashion group that includes Zara clothing retail shops.

Facebook Inc (FB.O) co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was fifth, at $54 billion.Bezos, 52, owns close to 18 percent of Amazon.

ewarticle strong>DAVOS, SWITZERLAND: Just eight individuals, all men, own as much wealth as the poorest half of the world's population, Oxfam said on Monday in a report calling for action to curtail rewards for those at the top.</strongAs decision makers and many of the super-rich gather for this week's World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, the charity's report suggests the wealth gap is wider than ever, with new data for China and India indicating that the poorest half of the world owns less than previously estimated.Oxfam, which described the gap as ""obscene"", said if the new data had been available before, it would have shown that in 2016 nine people owned the same as the 3.6 billion who make up the poorest half of humanity, rather than 62 estimated at the time.In 2010, by comparison, it took the combined assets of the 43 richest people to equal the wealth of the poorest 50 percent, according to the latest calculations.Inequality has moved up the agenda in recent years, with the head of the International Monetary Fund and the Pope among those warning of its corrosive effects, while resentment of elites has helped fuel an upsurge in populist politics.Concern about the issue was highlighted again in the WEF's own global risks report last week.""We see a lot of hand-wringing - and clearly Trump's victory and Brexit gives that new impetus this year - but there is a lack of concrete alternatives to business as usual,"" said Max Lawson, Oxfam's head of policy.""There are different ways of running capitalism that could be much, much more beneficial to the majority of people.""strong>SUPER-CHARGED CAPITALISM</strongOxfam called in its report for a crackdown on tax dodging and a shift away from ""super-charged"" shareholder capitalism that pays out disproportionately to the rich.While many workers struggle with stagnating incomes, the wealth of the super-rich has increased by an average of 11 percent a year since 2009.Bill Gates, the world's richest man who is a regular at Davos, has seen his fortune rise by 50 percent or $25 billion since announcing plans to leave Microsoft in 2006, despite his efforts to give much of it away.While Gates exemplifies how outsized wealth can be recycled to help the poor, Oxfam believes such ""big philanthropy"" does not address the fundamental problem.""If billionaires choose to give their money away then that is a good thing. But inequality matters and you cannot have a system where billionaires are systematically paying lower rates of tax than their secretary or cleaner,"" Lawson said.Oxfam bases its calculations on data from Swiss bank Credit Suisse and Forbes. The eight individuals named in the report are Gates, Inditex founder Amancio Ortega, veteran investor Warren Buffett, Mexico's Carlos Slim, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle's Larry Ellison and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

ewarticle ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Water and Power issued a statement on Friday saying that the contract to supply 650MW of electricity to K-Electric cannot be renewed.The ministry went on to say that K-Electric should ensure its own production at full capacity to meet the demands.It further said that in case of an emergency shortage, at most 200 to 300MW could be provided.A summary of the decision has been sent to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.According to a K-Electric spokesperson, he warned that if the supply is stopped then there could be a possible blackout in the city as the company has no backup plan. He also said that the matter of the ministry not supplying the requirement is sub judice and could lead to contempt of court. Meanwhile, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry President Iftikhar Ahmed Vohra said that if the national grid fails to provide the required demand, industrial production may be heavily affected.He demanded from the government that it should reconsider the supply of 650MW and include it in the contract.On January 26, the ministry had directed the National Power Control Centre (NPCC) not to suspend electricity supply to K-Electric following the expiry of the power distributors 5-year agreement for 650 MW supply on January 25.

current trends in oil prices and geopolitical impacts,"strong>LONDON: Oil edged above $50 a barrel on Thursday, drawing support from sources' comments that OPEC's Gulf members are willing to cut their output by 4 percent and from a further drop in U.S. crude inventories.</strongSaudi Arabia and its Gulf OPEC allies are willing to make that reduction from their peak oil output, energy ministers from the Gulf countries told their Russian counterpart this week, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.""That seems to be the reason behind the price move,"" said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank. ""But the big question is, how will they handle Iraq.""Brent crude was up 38 cents at $50.36 a barrel as of 1348 GMT, having risen as high as $50.67 intra-day. U.S. crude gained 28 cents to $49.46.Oil also drew support from the unexpected drop in U.S. crude inventories, and larger than expected falls in stocks of gasoline and distillates, reported this week, which raised hopes that a long-awaited market rebalancing is finally under way.""The global stock overhang must be reduced in order to see higher prices. Whilst such reduction is largely in the hand of OPEC, the re-balancing is already taking place in the U.S.,"" Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM said.The market was keeping an eye on escalating protests in Venezuela against the rule of President Nicolas Maduro, although there was no sign of any impact on the OPEC member's oil output. Venezuelan production has been falling this year as low prices hit investment.Doubts about the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' supply cut deal have been weighing on the market this week.OPEC agreed last month its first deal to restrain output in eight years to boost prices. But Iraq on Sunday called for Baghdad to be exempt, adding to the list of members seeking special treatment.A technical meeting at OPEC's headquarters on Friday, and with officials from non-OPEC countries on Saturday, is supposed to come up with recommendations on how to implement the supply cutback to the oil ministers' next meeting on Nov. 30.The OPEC plan is designed to speed up the removal of a supply glut that is keeping oil prices at less than half their level of mid-2014, cutting exporters' income and leading to investment cuts by oil companies worldwide.

ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices remained near 2016 highs in early trading on Thursday, buoyed by a fall in U.S. crude inventories, a weaker dollar and strong demand, but some analysts warned that the recent rally was starting to look overblown.</strongInternational Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were trading at $52.70 per barrel at 0045 GMT, up 19 cents from their last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was 32 cents higher at $51.55 a barrel.Traders said the price rises were largely a result of a drop in U.S. crude oil inventories.Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. crude stocks last week fell by 3.23 million barrels to 532.5 million barrels, marking their third consecutive weekly fall.A weaker dollar, down around 2.4 percent this month against a basket of other currencies, makes dollar-traded fuel imports for countries using other currencies cheaper, also supporting oil prices, traders said.But some analysts said there were also signs that the recent oil price rise, which saw Brent rally 6 percent this month and prices virtually double since February to one-year highs, may be overblown.ANZ bank said that price rises were ""tempered by an increase in crude production of 10,000 barrels per day to 8.75 million barrels per day and the number of active rigs increasing by 9 to 325"".Traders also warned of an ongoing build in refined product stocks in the United States and Asia.With fundamentals weighing both for and against higher prices, many traders and analysts say that a price tag of $50-60 for a barrel of crude was a fair value for oil, reflected in Brent's forward curve which stays within that range until early 2021. 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices dipped in early Asian trade on Monday as rising production in the Middle East outweighed falling US output and the recent slide in the dollar, which has been supporting crude.</strongBrent futures were trading at $47.05 (32 pounds) per barrel at 0028 GMT on Monday, down 32 cents from their last settlement. US crude was down 28 cents at $45.64 a barrel.Analysts said rising output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and especially the Middle East was outweighing supportive factors such as an ongoing, albeit slow, fall in U.S. output and a sliding dollar, which makes it cheaper for countries using other currencies to import dollar-traded fuel.""The weaker dollar failed to excite investors in the crude oil markets,"" ANZ bank said, citing a rise in OPEC-output as the main downward driver for prices.The dollar has fallen over 6 percent this year against a basket of other leading currencies.French bank BNP Paribas said that a recent oil rally, with prices jumping almost a third since April, was largely driven by sentiment and lacked physical fundamentals.""The recent rally in oil prices ... appears to have little to do with fundamentals,"" it said.""We see the recent rally as sowing the seeds of its own demise, and extending our recommendation to protect against short-term downside risk.""OPEC-supplies rose to 32.64 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, from 32.47 million bpd in March, according to a Reuters survey based on shipping data and information from sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.That almost matches January's 32.65 million bpd, when Indonesia's return to OPEC boosted production to records.Despite Monday's lower prices, other analysts are growing confident that a near-two-year rout in oil has ended, and many have raised their price forecasts.The chief of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil prices may have bottomed out, providing the health of the global economy does not pose a concern.""In a normal economic environment, we will see the price direction is rather upwards than downwards,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Sunday.Non-OPEC output is set to fall by more than 700,000 bpd this year, the biggest decline in around 20 years, he said.With global oil demand seen growing by 1.2 million bpd this year, the draw in global stockpiles will start soon, helping push up prices, he said.

What measures has the FBR taken to improve tax collection in Pakistan?,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) has begun chasing wealthy tax-dodgers who enjoy lives of extravagance and luxury, but revenue officials face huge challenges in trying to force the very richest  and most influential  to pay up.Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio of 9.5 percent is among the lowest in the world and the government is under pressure from foreign donors and lenders, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to increase collection to boost the struggling economy.Revenue authorities say they have identified about a quarter of a million new taxpayers who they project will add around 14 billion rupees ($140 million) to government coffers.Broadening the tax base and improving the economy after years of drift and sluggish growth under the last government was a key pledge in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif´s 2013 election campaign, when he was swept to power for a third time.Currently less than one percent of Pakistanis pay income tax and the government collected just $8 billion in total income tax in the 2013-14 fiscal year  barely enough to cover just the country´s defence expenditure of $7 billion.The finance ministry is aiming to boost the tax-to-GDP ratio to 15 percent in the current fiscal year ending June 30.As part of those efforts, the FBR is compiling lifestyle and vehicle data to try to trace unregistered taxpayers, including wealthy landlords and businessmen zipping between their luxury homes in imported Mercedes.""We are collecting information from the vehicle registration authority, car manufacturers, utility companies, telecom companies and property registration offices and tracing people who are not paying any tax,"" FBR spokesman Shahid Hussain told AFP.Taxpayer profilesThe data is used to generate profiles of potential taxpayers, after which demands are issued for them to pay income tax.""FBR has already issued notices to 261,250 potential tax payers,"" Hussain told AFP, adding that that new taxpayers have paid 570 million rupees since the crackdown started.It is not just dodgy businessmen who have been caught  several lawmakers have been found paying either no tax or very little and not filing their mandatory annual tax statements.The FBR has taken punitive measures against some ""chronic defaulters"", freezing nearly 300 bank accounts, seizing more than 100 vehicles, putting 78 properties up for sale and issuing arrest warrants in 40 cases.""Employing information technology, the FBR is creating a central database which would contain information about all taxpayers and nobody will be left undetected,"" Hussain said.A new FBR department tasked with broadening the tax net started working in July 2013 and within one year it started showing results, he added.But Pakistan is a country where wealth and political influence go hand in hand. For generations, landowners and industrialists have given patronage to political parties and scant attention has been paid to their assets by the taxman.Changing this privileged arrangement is a tricky proposition.Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for Pakistani daily The News who has done several major exposes on tax-dodgers, says the FBR´s commitment is encouraging, but he does not expect them to net any big fish.´War on tax cheats´""FBR is after those who can´t influence them,"" Cheema told AFP, citing several well-known tycoons considered among Pakistan´s richest whose names were missing from a list of the country´s top 100 taxpayers.""It can be done only by waging a war against tax cheaters without discrimination of good and bad cheaters,"" Cheema said.Pakistan´s central bank said in a recent report that tax revenue growth was not keeping up with budget targets.The tax take grew 11.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, against an annual target of 26.9 percent  but this was only half the growth of the same period during the previous fiscal year, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The central bank has urged the government to simplify tax procedures and do more to increase the documentation of the economy.A vast amount of business in Pakistan is done off the books, making transactions hard to trace and levy dues on.""Although FBR has taken a number of measures to increase tax collection, these focused more on deductions at source, and/or increasing the tax rates,"" a recent SBP report said, warning such measures had enjoyed ""limited success"" in the past.The IMF, though, has said the government´s reform programme  tied to a $6.6 billion loan from the Washington-based lender  was on track, and expects growth to accelerate to 4.3 percent in the 2014-15 fiscal year from 4.1 percent previously.But even with growth quickening and officials insisting they are making inroads, challenges to the government´s efforts to gather taxes remain considerable.

ewarticle KARACHI: Desperate to widen the tax base in a country where less then one percent of the population pay taxes, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has set a target to collect 138,000 more returns during the tax year 2015, officials said on Friday. The FBR has fixed a target of 1.05 million income tax returns during the year due to higher tax rates on non-filers. The FBR last year received 0.912 million tax returns. A senior official at Directorate of Broadening of Tax Base (BTB) of FBR said the FBR was estimating over 100,000 new income tax returns to be filed by the taxpayers during tax year 2015. The return filing for tax year 2015 will be completed by December with the filing by corporate sector. The filing of income tax returns for the tax year 2014 has been increased after measures taken in the budget 2015/2016 and it has increased to 912,000. The total number is still low as 3.5 million registered taxpayers are in the country. The directorate has gathered details of transactions on which tax was paid during 2013/2014 for the purposes of bringing new taxpayers in the system. According to details, Rs19.75 billion was collected from 2.46 million commercial and 0.29 million industrial electricity consumers. Similarly, about Rs52 billion of taxes were collected through withholding mechanism from 136.5 million mobile phone and 5.6 million landline telephone subscribers. In the banking system the FBR recorded 30.5 million transactions including saving accounts, national saving schemes and cash withdrawals on which the tax authorities collected over Rs50 billion. The directorate so far issued 344,572 notices to defaulters. Around 72,000 persons filed returns and paid Rs485 million tax. Through those notices, the directorate created demand of Rs16.87 billion and recovered Rs6.42 billion. During the recovery process the tax authorities resorted to harsh measures in 2,326 cases, which included: freezing of 1,366 bank accounts; issued arrest warrant in 343 cases; attached 195 properties and impounded 422 vehicles. 










"
impact of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes on US dollar and emerging markets,"Tokyo: The dollar eased against most currencies in Asia early Thursday after surging at the start of the week, while a strong unemployment reading boosted the Australian dollar.The Aussie surged more than one percent against the greenback, as government data showed the country´s October jobless rate fell to a better-than-expected 5.9 percent.Investors moved into high-yield, or riskier, emerging currencies as they await speeches by Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen and other US central bank policymakers for hints about their plans for US interest rates.With US economic data showing improvement, the Fed is considering hiking rates next month, at the same time as other central banks -- including in Europe and Japan -- are mulling further loosening as growth at home struggles.""Divergence in monetary policy is creating an even choppier investment environment,"" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets Plc, told Bloomberg News. ""The futures market is indicating that it´s more likely than not that we´ll see the Fed raise rates in December. Expectations of further easing in China are high because there´s been a demonstrated responsiveness among policy makers to the weakening economy.""The dollar has given up some of its strength in previous days after last week´s US jobs report boosted expectations Fed policymakers will hike rates for the first time in nine years at their next meeting.This week, a lot of the rate hike speculation has already been priced in, Koji Fukaya, chief executive officer at FPG Securities Co, told Bloomberg News.""Emerging and commodities currencies have more scope to react to positive news as they have priced in negative news,"" Fukaya said.""These currencies have been sold off, making some breathing space to recover when there (is) positive news.""In Tokyo trade Thursday Indonesian rupiah tacked on 0.2 percent, the South Korean won added 0.1 percent and the Malaysian ringgit was up 0.05 percent. The Taiwan dollar was up 0.2 percent and the Thai baht was also higher.Emerging units have climbed in Asia for the past three days after taking a hammering in response to the US jobs figures.The euro advanced to $1.0764 and 132.34 yen from $1.0741 and 131.94 yen.

ewarticle Tokyo: The dollar held steady on Wednesday after upbeat US inflation figures all but sealed the case for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike, analysts said.Financial markets are focused on the US central bank´s last 2015 meeting, which wraps up Wednesday, with policymakers likely to give the go-ahead to a rate rise for the first time in almost a decade.The case for a rate lift-off -- which is a plus for the dollar -- has grown stronger over the past year as the world´s top economy appeared to be staging a firm recovery.That view got another boost Tuesday as fresh November data showed an inflation gauge that excludes volatile food and energy prices hit the Fed´s 2.0 percent target.""For (Fed Chair) Janet Yellen, who has been at pains to emphasise her concern of inflation overshooting if rates are not hiked in 2015, this final data point surely locks in the Fed rate rise now,"" Angus Nicholson, a market analyst with IG Ltd. in Melbourne, wrote in a commentary.The benchmark federal funds rate has been pegged near zero since December 2008 to support the economy´s recovery from deep recession.In Tokyo trading, the dollar rose to 121.87 yen from 121.66 yen Tuesday in New York, while it gained 0.18 percent against the Malaysian ringgit, and also ticked up against the Taiwanese dollar, Thai baht, Indonesian rupiah and Singapore dollar.However, the South Korean won rose 0.67 percent on the greenback, as it bounced off recent drops.The euro edged up to $1.0936 and 133.18 yen from $1.0930 and 132.97 yen in US trading.The pound ticked up to $1.5050 from $1.5039 while the dollar edged down to 0.9901 Swiss Francs against 0.9914 francs in New York.While markets have been pricing in a rate hike, analysts said there was still room for the dollar to strengthen.""Money markets have not fully discounted a Fed rate hike, so there is scope for the US dollar to have a knee-jerk upside reaction,"" Elias Haddad, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, told Bloomberg News.""We expect the (Federal Open Market Committee) to emphasise that its tightening cycle will be gradual. This should slow rather than reverse the uptrend in the dollar."" 
ewarticle strong>Hong Kong: The dollar retreated against most of its major peers and emerging market currencies Wednesday, as analysts predict the Federal Reserve could hold off another hike in borrowing costs until April.</strongAs the effects of last week´s greenback rally -- fuelled by the US central bank´s first rate rise in almost a decade -- wear off, pressure has built on the unit as dealers decide to cash in at the end of the year.With a sense of optimism reappearing in regional markets -- and demand for higher-risk assets -- Asia tracked a rally on Wall Street for a second-successive day, boosting emerging currencies. And a lift in oil prices also supported commodity-based units.The dollar´s losses also come despite upbeat readings on US growth and consumer spending that indicate the Fed´s decision to begin lift-off was well justified.""There´s some paring of outstanding dollar long positions with investors reluctant to carry dollar exposure into the holidays,"" Ray Attrill, co-head of currency strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.""If you want to be at least modestly constructive on the US dollar early next year, which we are at this stage, you´re probably going to need to see the market attaching a higher probability"" to the Fed raising rates in the first quarter, he said.In morning Asian trade the dollar bought 121.03 yen, down from 121.10 yen in New York Tuesday and well off the levels above 123 yen touched last week. The euro was at $1.0950 against $1.0954 but sharply up from the $1.0830 mark last week.Australia´s dollar rose 0.04 percent against the US unit, while the South Korean won was 0.2 percent higher and Taiwan´s dollar gained 0.1 percent. There were also increases for the New Zealand and Canadian dollars as well as the Thai baht. 
ewarticle strong>NEW YORK: The U.S. dollar edged lower against a basket of major currencies on Friday, but still held near 14-year highs touched after Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting, with profit-taking halting the greenback's rally.</strongThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last at 102.900, not far from Thursday's 14-year high of 103.560 but down 0.12 percent on the day.The index gained 1.2 percent on Thursday to mark its biggest daily percentage gain in nearly six months a day after the U.S. central bank raised interest rates for the first time in a year. The Fed also signaled it was likely to hike rates three more times in 2017, up from the two increases forecast at the central bank's September meeting.The projections, combined with expectations that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration may boost domestic economic growth with fiscal stimulus, sent the dollar shooting higher and brought parity with the euro back in play.Profit-taking ahead of the weekend and expectations of a squeeze on dollar liquidity heading into year-end dampened the dollar's gains on Friday, analysts said.""The scale of the move since the FOMC meeting has been significant, and you would expect to see some kind of profit-taking on dollar longs,"" said David Gilmore, partner at FX Analytics in Essex, Connecticut.The euro was last up 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.0433 after hitting a nearly 14-year low of $1.0364 on Thursday, with the current level putting it about 4 percent away from parity with the dollar. The dollar was down 0.2 percent against the yen at 117.94 yen after hitting a roughly 10-1/2 month high of 118.66 yen on Thursday.Despite Friday's losses, the dollar remained on track to notch its biggest weekly percentage gains against the euro, yen, and Swiss franc in four weeks. The euro was on track to decline 1.2 percent against the dollar, while the dollar was set to gain 2.2 percent against the yen and about 1 percent against the Swiss franc for the week.""Were probably starting to thin out for the holidays as well,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was last down 0.3 percent at 1.0268 francs after touching 1.0344 francs on Thursday, its highest since August 2010. 
ewarticle strong>SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK: U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers are set this week to again cut their forecasts for how high interest rates will need to go in an economy where output, productivity and inflation are growing at a slower pace than in past decades.</strongIt would be the fourth time in 15 months that the U.S. central bank has been forced to admit its estimate of this so-called neutral rate was too optimistic, raising questions about the health of the economy in the coming years.The Fed, however, still insists low interest rates and its large balance sheet of bonds are sufficient to continue bolstering economic growth.Conversations with Fed officials suggest some will cut their predictions for the longer-run rate at this week's monetary policy meeting, with the median forecast possibly falling to 2.75 percent. It was 3.75 percent in June 2015 and 4.25 percent four years ago.The Fed is expected to leave its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged following its two-day meeting on Wednesday, according to a Reuters poll of economists.The Fed's policy rate has been about 0.38 percent since it was raised in December, the first increase in nearly a decade.The expected reduction in the longer-run neutral rate forecast amounts to a lower speed limit on future rate hikes, and points to fewer increases with longer gaps between them than U.S. central bankers and investors had expected.The lower the neutral rate forecast, the less anxious the Fed needs to be about tightening policy, which would justify its repeated decisions to defer rate increases.The result, says San Francisco Fed President John Williams, will be the ""shallowest"" set of rate hikes ever; ""much flatter,"" according to Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan in a separate conversation, than anything in the past.The Fed has not raised rates this year despite signaling in December that four rate hikes were coming in 2016. That number has since been scaled back to two hikes this year, with another three hikes in 2017, due to a global growth slowdown, financial market volatility and tepid U.S. inflation.But given the new thinking on the neutral rate, that seems overly optimistic.Fed policymakers say an aging U.S. population and decline in productivity growth is sapping economic potential, making them wary about raising rates too fast.""They are not very far from being in a tightening mode,"" said Shehriyar Antia, founder of Macro Insight Group and a former senior analyst at the New York Fed. ""That augers for more patience since the risk of you falling behind with inflation is less because it ain't going to take that much for rates to lean on inflation.""FED TOOLBOXRegardless of any reduction in the neutral rate estimate this week, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is likely to stick with her view that the central bank's so-called toolbox - its more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, low interest rates and planned gradual removal of stimulus - is appropriate for an economy that has consistently fallen short of growth forecasts.During the global central banking conference last month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellen said that policy mix had served the Fed well and would likely be useful in the face of a future economic downturn.But the Fed's constant walk-backs have served to undercut some of the market's faith in the central bank. Traders of short-term rate futures, for instance, are now betting the Fed will not hike rates until early next year.Still, any cut to the Fed's neutral rate forecast does not mean it will never raise rates.""They want to maintain market expectations for a rate hike in case they want to raise rates in December if conditions warrant one,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.The Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday and Yellen will hold a press conference shortly after. The Fed's rate-setting committee will meet again in early November and mid-December."

What impact did the weaker dollar have on crude oil prices?,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices rose in early Asian trade on Thursday, rebounding on a weaker U.S. dollar after falling around 3 percent or more in the previous session following a surprisingly large build in U.S. crude and distillate stocks last week.</strong""The weaker dollar is providing support for oil prices today. The direction of oil prices is governed by supply and the strength of the dollar,"" said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Sydney's Ayers Alliance.The U.S. dollar index slipped against a basket of currencies on Thursday. A weaker dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities including oil cheaper for holders of other currencies.U.S. crude futures had climbed 12 cents to $44.82 a barrel by 2025 EST, after falling $1.65, or 3.6 percent, in the previous session.Brent crude futures climbed 10 cents to $46.99 a barrel after settling $1.33 lower, or 2.8 percent, at the previous close.That came after U.S. crude inventories rose 2.3 million barrels to 1.221 billion barrels in the week to Aug. 26, data from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday. That compared with analyst expectations of a 921,000-barrel increase.Distillate stocks, which include diesel and heating oil, unexpectedly rose by 1.5 million barrels, while gasoline inventories fell by 691,000 barrels, about half the forecast drawdown.""In the absence of any price shocks, oil prices remain rangebound - as soon as oil gets down to the lower end of $40 a barrel prices find support. When oil gets down to $40-$42 investors buy, when it gets to $48-$50 they sell again"", Barratt said.Speculation the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers might agree to curb output at talks in Algeria later this month helped fuel an 11-percent rise in crude prices in August, the best monthly return since April.But optimism of an output freeze has since waned.""The market is very complacent on whether OPEC can come up with a supply freeze deal. The market doesn't believe OPEC has the ability to achieve an agreement freezing supply,"" Barratt added.Investors are also waiting for U.S. non-farm payroll data on Friday to give the market direction, ANZ Bank said in a note. 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices dipped in early Asian trade on Monday as rising production in the Middle East outweighed falling US output and the recent slide in the dollar, which has been supporting crude.</strongBrent futures were trading at $47.05 (32 pounds) per barrel at 0028 GMT on Monday, down 32 cents from their last settlement. US crude was down 28 cents at $45.64 a barrel.Analysts said rising output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and especially the Middle East was outweighing supportive factors such as an ongoing, albeit slow, fall in U.S. output and a sliding dollar, which makes it cheaper for countries using other currencies to import dollar-traded fuel.""The weaker dollar failed to excite investors in the crude oil markets,"" ANZ bank said, citing a rise in OPEC-output as the main downward driver for prices.The dollar has fallen over 6 percent this year against a basket of other leading currencies.French bank BNP Paribas said that a recent oil rally, with prices jumping almost a third since April, was largely driven by sentiment and lacked physical fundamentals.""The recent rally in oil prices ... appears to have little to do with fundamentals,"" it said.""We see the recent rally as sowing the seeds of its own demise, and extending our recommendation to protect against short-term downside risk.""OPEC-supplies rose to 32.64 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, from 32.47 million bpd in March, according to a Reuters survey based on shipping data and information from sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.That almost matches January's 32.65 million bpd, when Indonesia's return to OPEC boosted production to records.Despite Monday's lower prices, other analysts are growing confident that a near-two-year rout in oil has ended, and many have raised their price forecasts.The chief of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil prices may have bottomed out, providing the health of the global economy does not pose a concern.""In a normal economic environment, we will see the price direction is rather upwards than downwards,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Sunday.Non-OPEC output is set to fall by more than 700,000 bpd this year, the biggest decline in around 20 years, he said.With global oil demand seen growing by 1.2 million bpd this year, the draw in global stockpiles will start soon, helping push up prices, he said. 
ewarticle strong>New York: US oil prices finished above $50 a barrel for the first time since July on Tuesday as a tightening supply picture and a weaker dollar further boosted the commodity.</strongUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate for July delivery rose 67 cents to $50.36 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, capping a rally from the low near $25 a barrel in February.Analysts said ongoing uncertainty about Nigeria´s outlook for petroleum production was strengthening the oil market.Nigeria´s government and military chiefs met governors of oil-producing states after announcing it planned peace talks with militants who have repeatedly attacked pipelines and installations, slashing output.Attacks have cut output to 1.6 million barrels per day, well below the budgeted-for 2.2 million barrels per day, heaping further pressure on an economy badly hit by the global fall in the price of crude since mid-2014.Analysts said oil was also boosted by a dip in the dollar against major currencies after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Monday emphasized that interest rate increases would be gradual after Friday´s very weak jobs report. A weak dollar can boost demand for crude, which is sold on global markets in the US currency.""A good portion of what we´re seeing during the last couple of days is a reaction to the anticipation the Fed will not change its interest rates and that´s leading to a weaker dollar,"" said James Williams of WTRG Economics. 
ewarticle strong>SEOUL: Global benchmark oil futures rallied more than 2 percent on Friday, following Asian shares higher after Beijing deactivated a circuit breaker mechanism that was blamed for aggravating equity market crashes.</strongChinese stocks were also boosted as the yuan currency firmed in early trade after the central bank strengthened its official rate for the first time in nine trading days.Brent had risen 56 cents to $34.31 a barrel as of 0150 GMT, having hit an intraday high of $34.72. It settled down 48 cents at $33.75 in the previous session, after marking $32.16, a level last seen in April 2004.U.S. crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was trading 63 cents higher at $33.90 a barrel after settling at $33.27 on Thursday. In the last session, it hit its lowest since late 2003 at $32.10.OPEC's smallest member Ecuador, which has increased debt and reduced investments due to the oil price plunge, said on Thursday it would continue to press for production cuts at the cartel's next meeting scheduled for June.""Oil remains under pressure amid concerns about China's economy,"" ANZ said in a note on Friday.""With rising Middle East tensions now a distant memory, oil is likely to test the $30 a barrel level amid growing concerns on the impact of a weakening yuan on Chinese demand.""Natixis said in a research note that global demand should increase by 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) as opposed to 1.7 million bpd in 2015.""There are several clouds on the horizon which may impact demand growth such as the potential slowdown in China and any other emerging markets,"" it said.Chart-watching oil analysts said if oil prices do not rally hard on Friday, they seem doomed to drop below $30 a barrel for the first time since 2003. 
ewarticle SINGAPORE: Oil prices fell on Monday after closing the previous session at their lowest levels since March on renewed oversupply concerns from the United States and Iraq, although a weaker dollar helped to limit deeper losses.Investors are looking to the US Federal Reserve for direction this week. The central bank starts a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday that could result in a September interest rate hike that would strengthen the greenback.""The markets are looking for price guidance from Janet & Co,"" said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at Sydney's OptionsXpress, referring to Fed Chair Janet Yellen and the bank.""There is scope for the dollar bulls to be disappointed this week (which) might be a driver for oil prices and the commodities complex overall,"" Le Brun said.A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities, including oil, cheaper for consumers using other currencies.Brent crude for September was down 2 cents at $54.60 a barrel as of 0655 GMT after dropping 65 cents in the previous session to $54.62, its lowest close since March 19.US crude for September was down 12 cents at $48.02, after falling 31 cents in the previous session to $48.14, its lowest settlement since March 31. It hit an intra-day low of $47.72 on Friday, the lowest intraday price since April 1.Sparking new worries about a global glut, US oil producers added 21 drilling rigs last week, the biggest rise since April 2014, according to Baker Hughes.The increase in drilling activity came despite a 21 percent collapse in US crude prices from about $61 a barrel in mid-June. A 20 percent downturn is considered by many traders to constitute a bear market.In Iraq, exports from its southern oilfields are on course for a monthly record, having topped 3 million barrels per day so far this month, according to loading data and an industry source.The expectation of continued abundant oil supplies, including an output increase from Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led the National Australia Bank on Monday to revise its oil price forecasts in a monthly report.""We now expect oil prices to stay below $70 a barrel for the rest of 2015 and 2016,"" the bank said.Speculators cut long bets on US crude futures and options to the lowest level in five years last week, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.

impact of IEA report on global oil prices,"London: World oil prices sank Friday after the International Energy Agency warned over the price outlook amid bulging global supplies.In midday London deals, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April delivery fell 57 cents to $56.51 a barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April shed 72 cents to $46.33 a barrel.""Crude oil prices extended losses ... as investors remained cautious following the bearish IEA oil monthly report, high levels of crude oil inventories and the strong US dollar rally,"" said Sucden analyst Myrto Sokou.The Paris-based IEA energy watchdog warned Friday that the recent rebound in oil prices was built on flimsy foundations.Prices collapsed by 60 percent to about $40 between June and late January due to global oil oversupply, a weak world economy and the strong dollar.However, the market has since rebounded somewhat following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities.""Behind the facade of stability, the rebalancing triggered by the price collapse has yet to run its course, and it might be overly optimistic to expect it to proceed smoothly,"" said the Paris-based IEA, which advises energy consuming nations.It noted that a key driver in the recovery in oil prices has been drops in the number of rigs drilling for shale oil in the United States.""Yet US supply so far shows precious little sign of slowing down. Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations,"" said the IEA in its monthly report, which sharply revised up output estimates for the end of last year and forecasts for the start of 2015.The IEA hiked its demand forecasts for every quarter this year, with the annual 2015 figure bumped up by 100,000 barrels per day to 93.5 mbpd, compared with its previous forecast given last month.In earlier Asian trading, the oil market had risen on news of a deal to end a strike at US refineries.Crude futures had fallen Thursday after a government report showed surging US stockpiles, adding to a global oversupply.The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said inventories hit a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week, while stockpiles at the Cushing terminal hub in Oklahoma -- the price settlement point for WTI -- also increased.Bloomberg News meanwhile reported the United Steelworkers union representing 30,000 US oil workers had reached a tentative deal on a four-year contract with Royal Dutch Shell that could see a mass walkout brought to a close.Another development affecting the market was an announcement on Monday by the US Energy Information Administration raising its crude production forecast this year to 9.35 million barrels per day from 9.30 million.

ewarticle strong>LONDON: The world will store unwanted oil for most of 2016 as declines in U.S. output take time and OPEC is unlikely to cut a deal with other producers to reduce ballooning output, the International Energy Agency said.</strongThe agency, which coordinates energy policies of industrialised countries, said that while it did not believe oil prices could follow some of the most extreme forecasts and fall to as low as $10 per barrel, it was equally hard to see how they could rise significantly from current levels.The Paris-based IEA trimmed its forecast for 2016 oil demand growth, which now stands at 1.17 million barrels per day (bpd) following a five-year high of 1.6 million in 2015.It cut its call on OPEC crude for 2016 by 100,000 bpd to 31.7 million bpd. That figure is much lower than OPEC's January output of 32.63 million bpd.""Persistent speculation about a deal between OPEC and leading non-OPEC producers to cut output appears to be just that: speculation. It is OPEC's business whether or not it makes output cuts either alone or in concert with other producers but the likelihood of coordinated cuts is very low,"" the IEA said.Oil prices collapsed over the past 18 months to below $30 a barrel from as high as $115 as OPEC opened its taps to drive higher-cost producers such as U.S. shale companies out of the market.Low oil prices have spurred global demand but it was not enough to absorb all crude produced. As a result, unwanted oil went into storage, leading to record global stockpiles of over 3 billion barrels.U.S. shale oil output has started to decline because of low prices and OPEC has said it sees the market rebalancing sometime later in 2016 when demand finally meets supply.But the IEA said supply may still exceed demand throughout the whole of 2016 and added it saw non-OPEC output falling by just 0.6 million bpd in 2016.""The number could be higher of course and many senior international oil company figures have said so but there is a lingering feeling that the big fall-off in production from U.S. shale producers is taking an awful long time to happen. Perhaps resilience still has some way to go,"" the IEA said.The agency also said it saw the dollar remaining strong as it benefits from its safe-haven status, meaning more downward pressure on oil prices.With weaker global oil demand, likely new gains in Iraqi, Iranian and Saudi output, low chances of an OPEC deal, resilient U.S. production and a strong dollar - the IEA said the global oil glut was only poised to worsen.It said that even if OPEC production remained flat, global stocks would build by 2 million bpd in the first quarter, followed by a 1.5-million-bpd build in the second quarter.""Supply and demand data for the second half of the year suggests more stock building, this time by 0.3 million bpd. If these numbers prove to be accurate, and with the market already awash in oil, it is very hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly in the short term. In these conditions the short-term risk to the downside has increased. 
ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices resumed their decline in Asia Wednesday, with global crude oversupply continuing to dampen investors´ sentiment despite occasional rallies.Prices had risen the previous day after a four-day losing streak, as traders weighed a bearish price outlook from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and a lowered US estimate for crude production.The oil market has collapsed by more than half since mid-2014 with prices languishing under $50 a barrel, hurt by the supply glut and the decision by the oil exporter grouping OPEC to maintain output to counter booming US shale production.The Paris-based IEA, in a report Tuesday, forecast that the global oil market would recover to $80 a barrel by 2020.At around 0300 GMT Wednesday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was trading 47 cents lower at $43.74 and Brent crude for December was down 26 cents at $47.18.""We continue to think the market will remain in surplus through most of 2016, which is likely to restrict the upside for prices, particularly over the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016,"" British bank Barclays said in a market commentary.A strong dollar, fuelled by widening expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, has also been keeping a lid on prices.Oil is traded in the US currency and a buoyant dollar would make the commodity more expensive for those holding weaker units, lowering demand and prices.""We expect the greenback to continue to be supported as we approach the likely lift-off in rates,"" Singapore´s United Overseas Bank said, referring to a December 17 meeting of the Fed´s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. 










 
ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia on Tuesday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted that global oil prices will recover only partially over the next five years, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery slipped 74 cents to $52.12, while Brent crude for March eased 77 cents to $57.57 in afternoon trade. Citing a major shakeup in the oil markets, the IEA said in its five-year forecast that prices will recover from current levels of around $50-60 per barrel but remain considerably below the more than $100 price tags reached the slump began in June.""The global oil market looks set to begin a new chapter of its history, with markedly changing demand dynamics, sweeping shifts in crude trade and product supply, and dramatically different roles for OPEC and non-OPEC producers in regulating upstream supply,"" the IEA said.It added that it sees market rebalancing occurring ""relatively swiftly"", with increases in inventories halting mid-year and the market tightening.""This morning´s slight dip is likely due to the IEA report that predicts only a slow recovery for oil prices. However this is only in the short term as the market fundamentals have not changed,"" said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts.Prices have plunged from their mid-2014 peaks largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production and weak global demand.

ewarticle London: Oil prices ended the week firmer Friday, lifted by a recovery in share prices in China, which is the world´s biggest consumer of energy and major buyer of commodities generally.The crude market won a boost also from surging European stock markets, that were lifted mainly by hopes of a deal between Greece and its creditors. The International Energy Agency meanwhile forecast that global oil demand growth would slow in 2016 and that oil production in nations outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would stall.In its first estimates for 2016, the IEA forecast that oil demand would slow next year to 1.2 million barrels per day, compared with an average of 1.4 million barrels per day this year.Meanwhile growth in non-OPEC oil supply ""is expected to grind to a halt in 2016 as lower oil prices and spending cuts take a toll"", the IEA said in its monthly oil report.In trading Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in August climbed 42 cents to $53.20 a barrel compared with Thursday´s close.Brent North Sea crude for August advanced 62 cents to stand at $59.23 a barrel in London afternoon deals.- Chinese turbulence -US crude futures had sunk nearly eight percent Monday on worries about slowing global growth, as Greek voters rejected a bailout offer and China moved to calm financial market turbulence.""There are some signs that foreign investors are more optimistic about China´s efforts to arrest the stock slide,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets.""However, I feel much caution should be exercised and it is important to observe the Chinese markets in the coming sessions before calling it a bottom.""Aw added: ""As we have seen in the past, Chinese equities may recover in one session, only to fall straight back into a downward spiral the next day.""Chinese stocks surged for a second day on Friday as a government rescue plan offered a respite from a month-long rout.In a rollercoaster week, the Shanghai market gained 5.18 percent overall, after the government announced additional policies to avoid a market crash.But it is still down 24.9 percent from its closing peak on June 12. The stock market slide of recent weeks was a dramatic reversal of a 150-percent charge in the 12 months to its peak last month, fuelled by tens of millions of retail investors using borrowed funds.China´s economy, the world´s second largest, is already faltering. Gross domestic product expanded 7.4 percent in 2014, the slowest pace since 1990, and weakened further in the first three months of this year.But the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that there was no reason to lose faith in China´s economy because of the bursting stock market bubble.-- Greek relief --The oil market was focused also on Greece amid hopes debt-strapped nation would reach a deal with its creditors after Athens laid out details Thursday of a new bailout plan to save it from financial collapse.The package involves a pensions overhaul and tax hikes in return for debt relief and a rescue loan from the eurozone.Traders are also keeping an eye on negotiations in Vienna between western powers and Iran on a deal to curb Tehran´s nuclear ambitions and allow the lifting of punishing sanctions.Global powers leading the negotiations sought to ramp up the pressure for a deal, but Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back, saying Western countries among the so-called P5+1 group on the other side of the talks were backtracking on previous commitments.A lifting of sanctions will allow Iranian oil to flow back into the global market, adding to a supply glut and helping depress prices, according to analysts.Meanwhile US commercial crude stockpiles rose another 400,000 barrels to 465.8 million barrels in the week to July 3, even as refineries picked up activity. Gasoline inventories also jumped, with the summer holiday driving season in full swing. (AFP)

ewarticle ISLAMABAD: Following its approval from National Assembly, the lower house of the parliament, the upper house Senate on Wednesday also passed the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) bill 2015 amid protest from some opposition members.During the discussion, members of opposition parties criticized the government for presenting the bill in the house and urged that it should be presented in Council of Common Interest (CCI) for consultation with the provinces before its passage. Senator Tahir Hussain Mashhadi of MQM said that the the bill should have been presented in the CCI. He said any tax on natural resources cannot be imposed without consultation of provinces, he said.Senator Nauman Wazir and Sentor Saleem Mandviwala called for need to find a mechansim of gas infrastructure development and suggested that concerns of opposition should also be addressed.Opposition Leader Aitzaz Ahsan and Senators including Usman Saifullah, Mohsin Aziz, Shahi Syed, Saeed Ghani, Usman Kakar, Sassui Paleejo, Robina Adnan, Naseema Ehsan and Mohsin Leghari registered their opposing comments on the bill during discussion.Opposition members belonging to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Awami National Party (ANP) and Balochistan National Awami Party staged a token walk out from the House.Earlier, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in his winding up speech said National Assembly has already passed the Bill and said the government requires Rs1000 billion annually to maintain and improve gas infrastructure in the country.He said that Rs100 billion would be collated annually through this levy and it would be used for gas infrastructure and added that no province is self-sufficient in gas.He said that the production of gas is 4 BCFD and demand is 8 BCFD adding that it is very necessary to fund some important projects.He said that TAPI is Rs1 trillion project but our share is of Rs100 billion.The minister said that the collection amount of GIDC would not be misused and the parliament would oversee it.Shahid Khaqan said that the CCI itself says that the GIDC does not come into its domain and federal government should settle it. He said that Supreme Court has already decided that it is not a tax but a cess.Defending further the Cess Bill, he argued that to bridge the widening gas supply gap a number of gas import projects were being perused including the Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project, LNG import projects and LPG supply enhancement project in public as well as private sectors.He said that in case the required infrastructure was not developed for the above mentioned projects the government would be forced to import liquefied fuels which are much costlier as compared to gas.Further Pakistan would also be exposed to payment of liquidated damages or payments. According to him presently neither the federal government nor any gas utility has adequate funding to implement the above project.To create the required infrastructure it was therefore necessary that a new Cess may be imposed.He also accepted the idea of some opposition Senators for forming a committee to point out anomalies in the bill, which would prepare its recommendations to make the bill more beneficial.The minister went on to say that it would be the current government, which has planned to provide gas to every district of Balochistan APP/Geo News

current oil price trends and factors affecting them,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices remained near 2016 highs in early trading on Thursday, buoyed by a fall in U.S. crude inventories, a weaker dollar and strong demand, but some analysts warned that the recent rally was starting to look overblown.</strongInternational Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were trading at $52.70 per barrel at 0045 GMT, up 19 cents from their last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was 32 cents higher at $51.55 a barrel.Traders said the price rises were largely a result of a drop in U.S. crude oil inventories.Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. crude stocks last week fell by 3.23 million barrels to 532.5 million barrels, marking their third consecutive weekly fall.A weaker dollar, down around 2.4 percent this month against a basket of other currencies, makes dollar-traded fuel imports for countries using other currencies cheaper, also supporting oil prices, traders said.But some analysts said there were also signs that the recent oil price rise, which saw Brent rally 6 percent this month and prices virtually double since February to one-year highs, may be overblown.ANZ bank said that price rises were ""tempered by an increase in crude production of 10,000 barrels per day to 8.75 million barrels per day and the number of active rigs increasing by 9 to 325"".Traders also warned of an ongoing build in refined product stocks in the United States and Asia.With fundamentals weighing both for and against higher prices, many traders and analysts say that a price tag of $50-60 for a barrel of crude was a fair value for oil, reflected in Brent's forward curve which stays within that range until early 2021. 
ewarticle London: Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as the market seeks to build on strong gains in April following massive falls earlier in the year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in June won 56 cents to $59.49 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for June won 47 cents to stand at $66.93 a barrel in London midday deals.After slumping at the start of the year, oil prices rose by about a fifth in value during April owing to several factors including concerns about unrest in Yemen, the weakening dollar and fewer US rigs in operation, analysts said.However, prices remain well down after plunging almost 60 percent between June and the start of 2015 on the back of a global supply glut and ramped up production.""Crude oil producers in the US have significantly cut back output in an attempt to address the significant supply overhang which has exerted downward pressure on... prices since June last year,"" Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokers said on Tuesday.The International Monetary Fund has said that Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.""Saudi Arabia seem committed to defending their market share and have even increased output to over 10 million barrels per day in April,"" said Kamal.""Support for higher crude prices has partly come from a weaker dollar,"" he added.A weaker dollar makes oil priced in the US unit cheaper for holders of others currencies, boosting demand.

ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices remained under pressure in Asia Friday after a huge jump in US crude inventories reinforced projections that a supply glut will persist well into next year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in December was down 24 cents to $41.51 and Brent crude for December was trading four cents higher at $44.10 a barrel at around 0330 GMT.Prices were hammered Thursday after the US Department of Energy reported that commercial crude inventories in the world´s top oil consumer grew by 4.2 million barrels last week, far higher than analyst expectations of an increase of 1.3 million barrels.WTI sank 2.7 percent and Brent fell 3.8 percent after the report, which also showed US crude oil production continued to ramp higher.Global oil demand growth has not been fast enough to soak up the excess in supplies and analysts say a rebalancing of the supply-demand situation is needed for a sustained uptick in prices.Oil prices have plunged by more than half from peaks of over $100 a barrel in mid-2014.""Although global oil demand growth has been exceptionally strong year-to-date, the overall pace of supply side adjustment has been too slow to end a sustained increase in global inventories that we expect to persist through most of 2016,"" British bank Barclays said.It said in a market commentary that US offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico reached its highest level since early 2010 in August and is expected to remain strong although at a slower pace into 2016 ""as several more new fields begin to produce"".Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have also kept production high in an aggressive bid to retain market share.OPEC´s collective production has stabilised at around 31.5 million barrels per day in recent months, Barclays said, but this is still more than its output ceiling of 30 million barrels per day. 










 
ewarticle London: Oil prices nudged higher on Friday, further recovering from a steep dive seen mid-week, although demand is set to remain shackled by a global supply glut, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in May edged up one cent to $50.80 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for May gained 27 cents to $56.84 around midday in London.WTI and Brent sank 3.6 percent on Wednesday after the US Department of Energy said commercial inventories in the world´s biggest economy hit a record high last week.That came after Saudi Arabia´s Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said his country´s production had hit an all-time high of 10.3 million barrels a day in March.Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group, has said this week that rising imports of US crude oil could indicate improved demand prospects in the world´s largest oil consumer or concerns about supply tightening.Price support has meanwhile come from events concerning major oil producer Iran.Analysts attributed steep gains at the start of the week to investors concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.The United States on Thursday warned that sanctions on Iran will be lifted in stages as a nuclear deal is implemented, after Tehran demanded they be removed as soon as it comes into force.""Geopolitical factors remain a constant worry for investors with concerns regarding Iran´s nuclear programme potentially leading to ongoing volatility in the crude oil market,"" said Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokerage.

ewarticle London: Oil prices ended the week firmer Friday, lifted by a recovery in share prices in China, which is the world´s biggest consumer of energy and major buyer of commodities generally.The crude market won a boost also from surging European stock markets, that were lifted mainly by hopes of a deal between Greece and its creditors. The International Energy Agency meanwhile forecast that global oil demand growth would slow in 2016 and that oil production in nations outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would stall.In its first estimates for 2016, the IEA forecast that oil demand would slow next year to 1.2 million barrels per day, compared with an average of 1.4 million barrels per day this year.Meanwhile growth in non-OPEC oil supply ""is expected to grind to a halt in 2016 as lower oil prices and spending cuts take a toll"", the IEA said in its monthly oil report.In trading Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in August climbed 42 cents to $53.20 a barrel compared with Thursday´s close.Brent North Sea crude for August advanced 62 cents to stand at $59.23 a barrel in London afternoon deals.- Chinese turbulence -US crude futures had sunk nearly eight percent Monday on worries about slowing global growth, as Greek voters rejected a bailout offer and China moved to calm financial market turbulence.""There are some signs that foreign investors are more optimistic about China´s efforts to arrest the stock slide,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets.""However, I feel much caution should be exercised and it is important to observe the Chinese markets in the coming sessions before calling it a bottom.""Aw added: ""As we have seen in the past, Chinese equities may recover in one session, only to fall straight back into a downward spiral the next day.""Chinese stocks surged for a second day on Friday as a government rescue plan offered a respite from a month-long rout.In a rollercoaster week, the Shanghai market gained 5.18 percent overall, after the government announced additional policies to avoid a market crash.But it is still down 24.9 percent from its closing peak on June 12. The stock market slide of recent weeks was a dramatic reversal of a 150-percent charge in the 12 months to its peak last month, fuelled by tens of millions of retail investors using borrowed funds.China´s economy, the world´s second largest, is already faltering. Gross domestic product expanded 7.4 percent in 2014, the slowest pace since 1990, and weakened further in the first three months of this year.But the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that there was no reason to lose faith in China´s economy because of the bursting stock market bubble.-- Greek relief --The oil market was focused also on Greece amid hopes debt-strapped nation would reach a deal with its creditors after Athens laid out details Thursday of a new bailout plan to save it from financial collapse.The package involves a pensions overhaul and tax hikes in return for debt relief and a rescue loan from the eurozone.Traders are also keeping an eye on negotiations in Vienna between western powers and Iran on a deal to curb Tehran´s nuclear ambitions and allow the lifting of punishing sanctions.Global powers leading the negotiations sought to ramp up the pressure for a deal, but Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back, saying Western countries among the so-called P5+1 group on the other side of the talks were backtracking on previous commitments.A lifting of sanctions will allow Iranian oil to flow back into the global market, adding to a supply glut and helping depress prices, according to analysts.Meanwhile US commercial crude stockpiles rose another 400,000 barrels to 465.8 million barrels in the week to July 3, even as refineries picked up activity. Gasoline inventories also jumped, with the summer holiday driving season in full swing. (AFP)                        










"
What are the expected changes in the monetary policy of Pakistan in March?,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan on Saturday announced the new monetary policy for the next two months reducing the interest rate further by 50 basis points. The central bank reduced interest rate by 0.5 percent and brought it down to six percent.The State Bank of Pakistan noted year-on-year headline CPI inflation to have decelerated to 1.7 percent in August 2015 from 7.0 percent in August 2014. Following its declining trend of the past several months, the 12-month moving average CPI inflation came down to 3.6 percent in August 2015 from 8.4 percent in August 2014. A press release from the State Bank noted, With better law and order situation, investor and consumer confidence is improving. After recording a growth of 3.3 percent, Large-scale Manufacturing is expected to gain further traction at the back of improvement in energy supplies. Implementation of infrastructure development and energy projects under China Pakistan Economic Corridor would further enhance the improving investment environment. Therefore, there is anticipation of higher economic activity in FY16 which is expected to boost credit uptake. 










 
ewarticle KARACHI: The announcement of Monetary Policy for the next two months is likely to be made on March 21 by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The experts are expecting a further cut in the policy rate in view of improvement in the countrys foreign exchange reserves, stability in rupee value and the decline of inflation rate to 3 percent.They are expecting that the central bank might ratchet down the discount rate by 0.5 to 1 percent.The economic analysts are of the view that a further cut in the policy rate of the SBP will not only provide additional impetus to the business and economic activities but also help boost employment in the country.  










 
ewarticle strong>KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan cut its key policy rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 percent on Saturday, saying the country was on course to miss its economic growth target for the year.</strongThe bank said economic growth in the fiscal year ending June 2016 was likely to exceed last year´s 4.2 percent but miss the 5.5 percent target.The bank also said the inflation outlook was ""low"" despite headline inflation nudging up for seven consecutive months.The annual consumer inflation rate rose to 4.17 percent in April from 3.94 percent in March.Economists say Pakistan, a nation of 190 million people, needs to expand by at least 6 percent a year to absorb new entrants to the work force.In a statement, the bank said growth in the service sector and industrial activities would offset poor performance in the agricultural sector.There has also been an uptick in lending. ""GDP growth in FY16 is expected to provide the needed sustainability in growth trajectory and the basis for further improvement in FY17,"" the bank said in a statement.It added that foreign exchange reserves are expected to continue building, while the current account deficit will be at around 1 percent of GDP.Potential headwinds for the economy may come from an increase in global oil prices, the bank said.Pakistan is a net importer of oil. 
ewarticle KARACHI:  State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Saturday announced its monetary policy and decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.A statement issued here said that the average Jul-Oct FY16 inflation was at 1.7 percent is lower than the 7.1 percent average inflation in the corresponding period of last year.It said that the decline is broad based as both food and non-food and core inflation measures came down in this period.Going forward with subdued outlook of international oil price and other major commodity prices and in the absence of any shock to supplies of food items even though the average inflation would remain below the FY16 annual target of 6 percent the headline inflation is expected to reverse its declining momentum.Moreover market surveys indicate a marginal increase in inflation expectations for the coming months.The SBP statement further pointed out that the current account deficit despite a year on year 10.6 percent contraction in exports has narrowed down to $ 532 million in Jul-Oct FY16 from $ 1.9billion in Jul-Oct FY15. The improvement largely owes to declining oil price that has substantially reduced the oil import payments healthy workers remittances and the realization of Coalition Support Fund.At the back of official disbursements and Eurobond inflows surplus in capital and financial account has supported the overall balance of payments position thus ensuring an upward trajectory in foreign exchange reserves in Jul Oct FY16. Going forward continued flow of external resources would be required to maintain the stable balance of payments position.Furthermore, realization of investment inflows stemming from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor would indeed strengthen the external sector outlook over the medium to long term.Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) mainly supported by food and beverages, automobiles, fertilizers and cement production increased to 3.9 percent in Jul Sep 2015 compared to 2.6 percent in the same period of last year.Further boost to this growth is expected from expansion in cotton yarn manufacturing strong construction activities as per planned development spending increased automobile production encouraged by government schemes and improving energy supply at the back of recent LNG imports.Credit to private sector witnessed a nominal increase in July-October 2015 wherein fixed investments continued to expand for the fourth consecutive quarter from Q2 FY15 to Q1 FY16. As a result of easy monetary policy, the weighted average lending rates on fresh and outstanding loans at 7.8 percent and 9.2 percent in September2015 are the lowest in 10 years.Thus, with current credit cycle now entering in uptake phase and with improving LSM growth borrowing on account of both the working capital and fixed investment is likely to increase.This outlook would reflect in broad money (M2) growth going forward which during July 01-November 06, 2015 M2 has expanded by 0.2percent against 0.7 percent during the same period last year.While the Net Domestic Assets declined by Rs 78 billion Net Foreign Assets contribution in M2 growth remained substantial as it increased by Rs106 billion.In view of the foregoing the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.

Current trends in oil prices and US stockpiles,"New York: Oil prices fell on Wednesday before the release of a report on US crude inventories as traders kept an eye on unrest in crude exporter Libya.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in March shed $1.39 to $52.14 a barrel compared with Tuesday´s close.European benchmark Brent oil for April delivery slid $2.00 to $60.53 a barrel in London.The US Department of Energy will release its weekly stockpiles report on Thursday with many analysts expecting another large rise in stocks.Last week´s report showed that US crude inventories reached their highest levels on record for this time of the year.""The market had a very nice rebound from the $44-45 low it made a little while back,"" said Kyle Cooper, analyst at IAF Advisors in Houston.""But the fundamentals are still on the downside, and expectations are for a crude oil build"" on Thursday.""I don´t think the production growth is going to slow in the next couple of months.""Although leading producers like Chevron and ConocoPhillips have slashed capital budgets in light of the more than 50 percent plunge in global crude prices, the cuts are not expected to significantly affect short-term production levels.Traders were also keeping an eye on developments in north African crude oil producer Libya.Infighting and sabotage in Libya has reduced output to 150,000 barrels a day, down from a high of almost 1.5 million barrels per day, according to analysts.

ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Wednesday, giving up meagre gains in the previous session as investors await a US inventory report to gauge demand in the world´s top economy.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell 17 cents to $42.45 a barrel and Brent crude for October dipped 23 cents to $48.58 a barrel in late-morning Asian trade.Both contracts eked out modest rebounds in closing deals in New York on Tuesday.But analysts said prices were unlikely to stage a sustained rally because the market remains awash with supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia.Oil traders are also watching a report on US crude inventories in the week ending August 14 due later Wednesday to measure demand in the world´s biggest economy and large producer of shale oil.Analysts expect inventories to decline, but also said stockpile levels remain high after a weaker-than-hoped rise in demand during the summer driving season.""Output in the US has turned out to be more robust than many had previously assumed, as shale firms have dramatically slashed costs and increased their efficiency rather than cutting production,"" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at research firm Capital Economics.Demand growth is not keeping pace with supply, especially with the slowdown in China, the world´s top energy consuming nation and its second-biggest economy.Iran last month also reached an agreement with major world powers to rein in its nuclear ambitions in exchange for the lifting of crippling Western economic sanctions which have restricted its oil exports.""This renewed decline in oil prices has largely been driven by a combination of concerns about demand, notably from China, and continued strong growth in supply,"" said Pugh.""OPEC has increased its output by almost 1.4 million barrels per day since January and the potential return of exports from Iran early next year could exacerbate the supply glut,"" he said.

ewarticle strong>TOKYO: Oil prices fell on Tuesday as concerns mount that a rally since January is fizzling out, while analysts forecast another rise to record levels for US crude stockpiles.</strongUS oil CLc1 was down 30 cents at $39.09 a barrel at 0553 GMT, after finishing down 7 cents at $39.39, the previous session.Brent LCOc1 fell 35 cents to $39.92. On Monday it settled down 17 cents at $40.27 a barrel.US commercial crude oil stockpiles were expected to have reached record highs for a seventh straight week, while refined product inventories likely fell, a preliminary Reuters survey showed late on Monday.The poll of eight analysts, taken ahead of weekly inventory reports from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA), estimated, on average, that crude stocks rose 3.2 million barrels in the week ended March 25.The API will release its data on Tuesday at 2030 GMT, while the EIA will publish its data on Wednesday at 1430 GMT.Both oil benchmarks are up about 50 percent from 12-year lows hit in mid-February but the oil market has taken on a weaker tone in the past week, along with other commodities.""The numbers continue to suggest a supply glut and I suspect that more talk is relevant out of OPEC and Co to help the price stand up or to help it remain relatively stable,"" said Jonathan Barratt, Chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance in Sydney.He was referring to plans by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major suppliers including Russia to meet next month to discuss an output freeze in the hope they can support prices.The plans for the April 17 meeting in Qatar have been a major component of the rally.But with stockpiles high and signs that some OPEC members are losing market share, along with few signs of demand returning, prices are likely to trade in a range.""The likes of Russia and the likes of Iran ... are cutting deals left right and centre just to get cash flow,"" said Barratt.""Given the absence of economic numbers supporting increases in demand we continue to go sideways,"" he said.Most analysts are predicting the end of the year-and-a-half long slump, but also betting that there is little upside in the near future.Barclays said net flows into commodities totalled more than $20 billion in January-February, the strongest start to a year since 2011, and prices could fall 20 to 25 percent if that were reversed.""Were such a scenario to unfold, the price of oil could fall back to the low $30s,"" it said on Monday."

Current trends in US crude oil stockpile levels and market prices,"New York: Oil prices fell on Wednesday before the release of a report on US crude inventories as traders kept an eye on unrest in crude exporter Libya.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in March shed $1.39 to $52.14 a barrel compared with Tuesday´s close.European benchmark Brent oil for April delivery slid $2.00 to $60.53 a barrel in London.The US Department of Energy will release its weekly stockpiles report on Thursday with many analysts expecting another large rise in stocks.Last week´s report showed that US crude inventories reached their highest levels on record for this time of the year.""The market had a very nice rebound from the $44-45 low it made a little while back,"" said Kyle Cooper, analyst at IAF Advisors in Houston.""But the fundamentals are still on the downside, and expectations are for a crude oil build"" on Thursday.""I don´t think the production growth is going to slow in the next couple of months.""Although leading producers like Chevron and ConocoPhillips have slashed capital budgets in light of the more than 50 percent plunge in global crude prices, the cuts are not expected to significantly affect short-term production levels.Traders were also keeping an eye on developments in north African crude oil producer Libya.Infighting and sabotage in Libya has reduced output to 150,000 barrels a day, down from a high of almost 1.5 million barrels per day, according to analysts.

ewarticle strong>TOKYO: Oil prices fell on Tuesday as concerns mount that a rally since January is fizzling out, while analysts forecast another rise to record levels for US crude stockpiles.</strongUS oil CLc1 was down 30 cents at $39.09 a barrel at 0553 GMT, after finishing down 7 cents at $39.39, the previous session.Brent LCOc1 fell 35 cents to $39.92. On Monday it settled down 17 cents at $40.27 a barrel.US commercial crude oil stockpiles were expected to have reached record highs for a seventh straight week, while refined product inventories likely fell, a preliminary Reuters survey showed late on Monday.The poll of eight analysts, taken ahead of weekly inventory reports from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA), estimated, on average, that crude stocks rose 3.2 million barrels in the week ended March 25.The API will release its data on Tuesday at 2030 GMT, while the EIA will publish its data on Wednesday at 1430 GMT.Both oil benchmarks are up about 50 percent from 12-year lows hit in mid-February but the oil market has taken on a weaker tone in the past week, along with other commodities.""The numbers continue to suggest a supply glut and I suspect that more talk is relevant out of OPEC and Co to help the price stand up or to help it remain relatively stable,"" said Jonathan Barratt, Chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance in Sydney.He was referring to plans by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major suppliers including Russia to meet next month to discuss an output freeze in the hope they can support prices.The plans for the April 17 meeting in Qatar have been a major component of the rally.But with stockpiles high and signs that some OPEC members are losing market share, along with few signs of demand returning, prices are likely to trade in a range.""The likes of Russia and the likes of Iran ... are cutting deals left right and centre just to get cash flow,"" said Barratt.""Given the absence of economic numbers supporting increases in demand we continue to go sideways,"" he said.Most analysts are predicting the end of the year-and-a-half long slump, but also betting that there is little upside in the near future.Barclays said net flows into commodities totalled more than $20 billion in January-February, the strongest start to a year since 2011, and prices could fall 20 to 25 percent if that were reversed.""Were such a scenario to unfold, the price of oil could fall back to the low $30s,"" it said on Monday. 
ewarticle London: Oil prices rebounded slightly Tuesday after recent sharp losses caused by an oversupplied market.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April delivery rose 39 cents to $49.84 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for April climbed 51 cents to stand at $59.41 a barrel in London afternoon deals.WTI shed $1.36 in New York and Brent lost $1.32 on Monday, building on heavy losses last Friday, as US crude stockpiles linger at historic levels, contributing to a global oversupply.A closely watched report on US weekly crude stockpiles is next due on Wednesday, with a Bloomberg News survey saying inventories are expected to have risen by 3.75 million barrels.US oil stockpiles are already at their highest level on record at this time of year.""The expectation of further rising US crude oil stocks is pressuring prices,"" said Commerzbank analysts in a note to clients.Globally, crude supplies are also being boosted after oilfields in eastern Libya resumed pumping to the port of Hariga after a pipeline was repaired, and oil producer Oman plans to ramp up output to 980,000 barrels a day this year.""The partial return of supply from Libya is weighing on the Brent price despite its sustainability being anything but certain,"" said Commerzbank.Crude prices lost about 60 percent of their value to about $40 between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and a strong dollar.Prices have risen above multi-year lows following a slowdown in US oil drilling activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.""It is apparent by now that drilling in the US will slow, global production growth is expected to be lower, and demand, at least in the US, is reacting positively to lower prices,"" British bank Barclays said in a report.""In short, the market is forecast to remain oversupplied for most of 2015, but expectations beyond that are for more balanced fundamentals.""

""We got quite a bit ahead of ourselves here."" Smith said it is likely still too soon for the lower US rig count to meaningfully dent supply.""Yes, there are a couple of data points, but that doesn´t mean the US is not overflowing crude,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Paris-based International Energy Agency cut its supply forecast for non-OPEC countries, citing a lower outlook for US and Canadian production and the ""worsening conflict"" in Yemen.The agency also bumped up by 90,000 barrels per day its forecast for 2015 petroleum demand. The IEA now expects 2015 consumption of 93.6 million barrels per day, up 1.1 million barrels per day for the year. (AFP)                        










"
Impact of US Federal Reserve comments on dollar value and interest rates,"strong>Hong Kong: The dollar retreated against most of its major peers and emerging market currencies Wednesday, as analysts predict the Federal Reserve could hold off another hike in borrowing costs until April.</strongAs the effects of last week´s greenback rally -- fuelled by the US central bank´s first rate rise in almost a decade -- wear off, pressure has built on the unit as dealers decide to cash in at the end of the year.With a sense of optimism reappearing in regional markets -- and demand for higher-risk assets -- Asia tracked a rally on Wall Street for a second-successive day, boosting emerging currencies. And a lift in oil prices also supported commodity-based units.The dollar´s losses also come despite upbeat readings on US growth and consumer spending that indicate the Fed´s decision to begin lift-off was well justified.""There´s some paring of outstanding dollar long positions with investors reluctant to carry dollar exposure into the holidays,"" Ray Attrill, co-head of currency strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.""If you want to be at least modestly constructive on the US dollar early next year, which we are at this stage, you´re probably going to need to see the market attaching a higher probability"" to the Fed raising rates in the first quarter, he said.In morning Asian trade the dollar bought 121.03 yen, down from 121.10 yen in New York Tuesday and well off the levels above 123 yen touched last week. The euro was at $1.0950 against $1.0954 but sharply up from the $1.0830 mark last week.Australia´s dollar rose 0.04 percent against the US unit, while the South Korean won was 0.2 percent higher and Taiwan´s dollar gained 0.1 percent. There were also increases for the New Zealand and Canadian dollars as well as the Thai baht. 
ewarticle strong>NEW YORK: The U.S. dollar edged lower against a basket of major currencies on Friday, but still held near 14-year highs touched after Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting, with profit-taking halting the greenback's rally.</strongThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last at 102.900, not far from Thursday's 14-year high of 103.560 but down 0.12 percent on the day.The index gained 1.2 percent on Thursday to mark its biggest daily percentage gain in nearly six months a day after the U.S. central bank raised interest rates for the first time in a year. The Fed also signaled it was likely to hike rates three more times in 2017, up from the two increases forecast at the central bank's September meeting.The projections, combined with expectations that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration may boost domestic economic growth with fiscal stimulus, sent the dollar shooting higher and brought parity with the euro back in play.Profit-taking ahead of the weekend and expectations of a squeeze on dollar liquidity heading into year-end dampened the dollar's gains on Friday, analysts said.""The scale of the move since the FOMC meeting has been significant, and you would expect to see some kind of profit-taking on dollar longs,"" said David Gilmore, partner at FX Analytics in Essex, Connecticut.The euro was last up 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.0433 after hitting a nearly 14-year low of $1.0364 on Thursday, with the current level putting it about 4 percent away from parity with the dollar. The dollar was down 0.2 percent against the yen at 117.94 yen after hitting a roughly 10-1/2 month high of 118.66 yen on Thursday.Despite Friday's losses, the dollar remained on track to notch its biggest weekly percentage gains against the euro, yen, and Swiss franc in four weeks. The euro was on track to decline 1.2 percent against the dollar, while the dollar was set to gain 2.2 percent against the yen and about 1 percent against the Swiss franc for the week.""Were probably starting to thin out for the holidays as well,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was last down 0.3 percent at 1.0268 francs after touching 1.0344 francs on Thursday, its highest since August 2010. 
ewarticle New York: The dollar weakened Tuesday after huge gains the prior week appeared to encourage profit taking, while the euro benefited from Greece´s progress toward a bailout.""A lull in the US economic calendar over the first half of the week has enticed many to cash in a few of the dollar´s big two percent gains from last week which amounted to its best weekly performance in two months,"" said Joe Manimbo at Western Union Business Solutions.The euro rose to $1.0942 around 2100 GMT from $1.0824 at the same time Monday. The dollar also fell against the yen, to 123.86 from 124.30.The dollar´s weakness should be fleeting as the US Federal Reserve readies an interest rate increase, said Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management, with the next update of the Fed´s stance coming after a policy meeting on July 29.""Although the Fed is not expected to raise interest rates in July, the tone of the monetary policy statement should be optimistic, reinforcing the notion that the economy is ready for tightening,"" she said.Last week Fed chief Janet Yellen said the rate hike was likely this year, underpinning the dollar´s rally. In Europe, there was positive movement in Greece´s efforts to gain a new bailout. The Greek government submitted to parliament a second batch of reform measures needed to start negotiations, with a vote scheduled for Wednesday.""The euro is higher as progress continues to be made toward a third financial assistance program for Greece,"" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Securities.

The euro changed hands at $1.0809 and 129.92 yen, down from $1.0871 and 130.54 yen in New York but still well above $1.0595 and 128.57 yen in Asia on Wednesday.While the US central bank opened the door for a rise from six years of zero percent rates, it lowered its forecasts for economic growth and inflation and stressed it would remain cautious before making any move.""It´s fair to say we now have somewhat stronger doubt that Fed rates ´lift-off´ will begin a early as June, than we did heading into the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)"" meeting, National Australia Bank said.""The key takeaway is that (Fed chief Janet) Yellen has successfully established in the market´s mind the data, rather than date, dependency of Fed policy.""After a two-day meeting, the Fed on Wednesday issued a statement that removed a pledge to remain ""patient"" on raising interest rates, signalling a possible mid-year rate increase.However Yellen stressed growth prospects were more muted than three months ago, despite strong increases in jobs creation. She noted consumer spending has slipped, inflation has declined, wages are flat, and the stronger dollar has hurt US exports.The policy committee lowered its rate outlook to 0.5-0.75 percent for the end of this year from 1.0 percent previously, while also reducing its 2016 forecast to 1.75-2.5 percent from 2.5 percent. ""Just because we removed the word patient from the statement doesn´t mean we´re going to be impatient,"" Yellen told reporters.Markets have been focusing on the Fed´s timing for a rate hike -- a plus for the dollar -- with Yellen´s comments giving much-needed relief for the euro, which has been hammered by the European Central Bank´s new stimulus programme.While some analysts pegged the dollar to fall further, loose monetary policy in major economies was likely to stem its losses, said Sebastien Galy, a senior currency strategist at Societe Generale.""The dollar will resume its uptrend vs G10 in the next few weeks driven by the pressure of negative interest rates elsewhere,"" he wrote in an e-mail, according to Bloomberg News.

Impact of China's PMI on global oil prices,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices dropped on Tuesday after activity in China's factory sector fell to an 11-month low and as Saudi Arabia said its production was close to an all-time high.The flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 49.2 in March, below the 50-point level that separates growth in activity from a contraction on a monthly basis, stoking worries over the strength of the world's No.2 economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 50.6.""Considering that the preliminary PMI figures for major crude importers turned out much lower than estimates ... we expect both WTI and Brent to end-off today lower,"" Singapore-based Phillip Futures said on Tuesday.The PMI drop in China followed an overnight report that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, was now pumping around 10 million barrels of crude oil per day, a near all-time high and some 350,000 bpd above the figure Saudi Arabia gave to OPEC for its February output.""The market was under pressure early in the trading day after comments from Saudi Arabia that it was producing almost 10 million barrels per day,"" ANZ bank said on Tuesday.Brent crude oil futures were trading down 47 cents at $55.45 a barrel at 0750 GMT. U.S. WTI crude dropped 65 cents to $46.80 a barrel.Worries over slowing growth in China's economy as well as high production have contributed to a global surplus in oil supplies.""We expect crude prices to be pressured once again by the weight of some 2 million barrels per day of oversupply in Q2 2015,"" energy consultancy FGE said in a note on Tuesday.The refinery sector has benefited from cheap oil, which has improved margins for oil products such as diesel or jet fuel.""A sharp decline in crude prices over late 2014 and into January 2015, followed by an extraordinarily cold February (in the United States and parts of Europe), has meant good times for refiners,"" FGE said, but it added that high refinery margins were unlikely to last.""In H2 2015, we see an oversupplied products market even as crude prices begin to recover.

This compared with a fall of 8.9 percent in July.Imports dropped 14.3 percent, from an 8.6 percent decrease in July.""This data just reinforces the view we are still seeing weakness in the Chinese economy and this data point suggests we have not seen a bottom yet,"" Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets, told AFP.""China´s economy remains a worry for the wider world economy and global asset markets,"" he added.The data was the first in a string of economic figures this week that will be used as a barometer of the state of the Chinese economy, the world´s second-biggest and a crucial driver of global growth.Oil prices have come under pressure from concerns that China´s slowing economy will curb demand for the commodities that have helped feed its astonishing growth over the past three decades.The devaluation of the yuan on August 11 fuelled economic fears, sparking a slump in world equities sending commodities, as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index of 22 raw materials, to a 16-year-low before stabilising near current levels.Oil prices are down almost 30 percent from this year´s closing peak in May, according to Bloomberg News data.Analysts said dealers would next scrutinise the latest weekly US petroleum report due Thursday, a day later than usual due to a holiday on Monday.US crude reserves currently sit near an eight-decade peak due to high production levels despite tepid demand.Dealers had been hoping that an uptick in US demand, coupled with a slowdown in output, could whittle down the huge global supplies that were a key reason for the collapse in prices from around $120 in June last year.

This would likely be weighing down on commodity usage in China,"" Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said in a market commentary.""With weak Chinese industrial production, we may see Chinese manufacturing PMI worsen, thus, leading to weaker oil prices,"" he said, referring to the forward-looking Purchasing Managers´ Index to be released later this week.The market will also be on the lookout for economic data from the United States and the eurozone expected to be released this week.""Considering the expectations for both China and eurozone, we could see US being the tie breaker between oil bulls and bears. US data has not been exceptionally strong, and thus, could mean that oil prices could be facing some headwinds towards the end of the week,"" Ang said.In Asian trade, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery was down 10 cents to $47.16 and Brent crude for December fell 12 cents to $50.34 a barrel at around 0300 GMT.Both contracts fell for four straight trading days last week before advancing Friday on the back of data showing a fresh decline in US oil exploration, which suggested lower output that could help ease the global oversupply.Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY, said the market will also be seeking clues from a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC technical experts in Vienna on Wednesday.Oil-producer Russia said last week it was prepared to discuss output cuts during the meeting.                        










 
ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices edged higher in quiet Asian trade Wednesday as dealers set aside weak Chinese trade data and looked ahead to the release of a US stockpiles report, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery gained 22 cents to $46.16 while Brent crude for October rose 24 cents to $49.76 in late-morning trade.""We are seeing trading volumes for oil futures down a third than on average. The market seems to have shrugged off the weak Chinese trade data and is now looking beyond that for cues,"" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at IG Markets in Sydney, told AFP.""We might see some movement next depending on how the US stockpile numbers turn out,"" he said.China said Tuesday its exports fell 5.5 percent year-on-year in August while imports plunged 13.8 percent, led by falling commodity prices, adding to worries about the strength of the world´s number two economy and top energy consumer.The slowdown Chinese growth, as well as a slew of other weak indicators, have sent panic through world markets, as the country is a key driver of global expansion.In the United States, the Department of Energy will release its weekly petroleum report on Thursday, a day later than usual owing to the Labor Day holiday on Monday.US crude reserves likely rose by 250,000 barrels in the week to September 4, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts. An increase in stockpiles usually points towards weaker demand.Dealers had been hoping that an uptick in US demand, coupled with a slowdown in output, could whittle down the huge global supplies that were a key reason for the collapse in prices from around $120 in June last year.                        










 
ewarticle London: Oil prices ended the week firmer Friday, lifted by a recovery in share prices in China, which is the world´s biggest consumer of energy and major buyer of commodities generally.The crude market won a boost also from surging European stock markets, that were lifted mainly by hopes of a deal between Greece and its creditors. The International Energy Agency meanwhile forecast that global oil demand growth would slow in 2016 and that oil production in nations outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would stall.In its first estimates for 2016, the IEA forecast that oil demand would slow next year to 1.2 million barrels per day, compared with an average of 1.4 million barrels per day this year.Meanwhile growth in non-OPEC oil supply ""is expected to grind to a halt in 2016 as lower oil prices and spending cuts take a toll"", the IEA said in its monthly oil report.In trading Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in August climbed 42 cents to $53.20 a barrel compared with Thursday´s close.Brent North Sea crude for August advanced 62 cents to stand at $59.23 a barrel in London afternoon deals.- Chinese turbulence -US crude futures had sunk nearly eight percent Monday on worries about slowing global growth, as Greek voters rejected a bailout offer and China moved to calm financial market turbulence.""There are some signs that foreign investors are more optimistic about China´s efforts to arrest the stock slide,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets.""However, I feel much caution should be exercised and it is important to observe the Chinese markets in the coming sessions before calling it a bottom.""Aw added: ""As we have seen in the past, Chinese equities may recover in one session, only to fall straight back into a downward spiral the next day.""Chinese stocks surged for a second day on Friday as a government rescue plan offered a respite from a month-long rout.In a rollercoaster week, the Shanghai market gained 5.18 percent overall, after the government announced additional policies to avoid a market crash.But it is still down 24.9 percent from its closing peak on June 12. The stock market slide of recent weeks was a dramatic reversal of a 150-percent charge in the 12 months to its peak last month, fuelled by tens of millions of retail investors using borrowed funds.China´s economy, the world´s second largest, is already faltering. Gross domestic product expanded 7.4 percent in 2014, the slowest pace since 1990, and weakened further in the first three months of this year.But the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that there was no reason to lose faith in China´s economy because of the bursting stock market bubble.-- Greek relief --The oil market was focused also on Greece amid hopes debt-strapped nation would reach a deal with its creditors after Athens laid out details Thursday of a new bailout plan to save it from financial collapse.The package involves a pensions overhaul and tax hikes in return for debt relief and a rescue loan from the eurozone.Traders are also keeping an eye on negotiations in Vienna between western powers and Iran on a deal to curb Tehran´s nuclear ambitions and allow the lifting of punishing sanctions.Global powers leading the negotiations sought to ramp up the pressure for a deal, but Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back, saying Western countries among the so-called P5+1 group on the other side of the talks were backtracking on previous commitments.A lifting of sanctions will allow Iranian oil to flow back into the global market, adding to a supply glut and helping depress prices, according to analysts.Meanwhile US commercial crude stockpiles rose another 400,000 barrels to 465.8 million barrels in the week to July 3, even as refineries picked up activity. Gasoline inventories also jumped, with the summer holiday driving season in full swing. (AFP)                        










"
Moody's rating upgrade for Pakistan's dollar bonds,"KARACHI: Moodys upgraded Pakistans dollar bonds rating one notch from stable to positive on Wednesday on the back of the countrys improving macroeconomic indicators.The financial ratings firm said its decision came in view of Pakistans strengthening foreign exchange reserves.Pakistan has been trying to boost its flagging economy since Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was elected nearly two years ago.""Moody´s Investors Service has revised the outlook on Pakistan´s foreign currency government bond rating to positive from stable,"" the company said in a statement.Pakistan issued $1 billion in five-year Sukuk Bonds, the Islamic version of eurobonds, in November last year to boost foreign exchange reserves.In April 2014, the country issued $2 billion worth of eurobonds, in five and 10 year terms,Pakistan´s net foreign currency reserves with the central State Bank reached to $11.2 billion up to March 13, from just $3.2 billion in January 2014.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has voiced satisfaction with Pakistan´s progress on reforms required under a $6.6-billion bailout agreed in 2013.The loan came on condition that Pakistan -- which was suffering an energy crisis -- would carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody´s said continued success under the IMF programme would act as ""upward triggers to the rating"".The central State Bank of Pakistan on the weekend slashed its benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point to eight percent.The bank noted that the economy was now on a more stable footing and was benefiting from the drop in world oil prices. 










 
ewarticle ISLAMABAD: Moody's Investor Service has upgraded Pakistans sovereign credit rating by a notch, from Caa1 to B3, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar announced on Thursday in the National Assembly.According to Dar, Moody's had downgraded the countrys credit rating to Caa1 on July 13, 2012.The outlook for the rating back then was negative. A sovereign with a Caa rating is judged to be of poor standing and subject to very high credit risk.Weak government finances, structural inflationary pressures and domestic political uncertainties were adding to Pakistan's external vulnerabilities and debt sustainability, thereby compounding the downward pressure on sovereign creditworthiness, Moodys said.Moody's also said the downgrade was also prompted by an upcoming repayment of $7.5 billion to the International Monetary Fund. 










 
ewarticle LIMASSOL: Moodys Investors Service on Wednesday changed the outlook for the Pakistan banking system to stable from negative, reflecting the improvement in the countrys economic growth prospects, driven in turn by the governments commitment to economic reforms under its IMF program.We expect the strengthening economy, together with the central banks accommodative monetary policy, to stimulate lending growth and support the banking sectors loan performance over the next 12-18 months,"" said Elena Panayiotou, a Moodys Assistant Vice President and lead analyst for Pakistani banks.Moodys forecasts Pakistans real GDP will expand by 4.0 per cent in the fiscal year ending June 2016 (compared to a sluggish 2.8pc during 2008-13), mainly driven by higher spending on infrastructure projects as the government aims to ease energy shortages and execute projects associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The rating agency noted that the strengthening of the domestic economy will contribute to the improvement in Pakistani banks asset quality. The level of credit risk, however, will remain high as banks are heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign (B3, stable) through holdings of securities and government-related loans, which were equivalent in size to 7.3x Tier 1 capital, exposing banks to event risk.""We expect problem loans will decline to around 12 per cent of total loans by the end of 2016 compared with 12.4pc for the end of June 2015. Banks, however, will remain heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign, linking the banks creditworthiness to that of the sovereign"" Panayiotou said.In the area of capital, the rating agency expected that buffers will come under pressure due to moderate asset growth and lower internal capital generation  a result of weaker profitability.Moodys expected earnings to ease slightly over the outlook period, mainly because of the lower coupon on government securities in a declining interest rate environment and as the markets perception of Pakistans risk profile eases (upgraded to B3 from Caa1 on June 11, 2015). Higher loan volumes and capital gains booked through the sale of government securities will only partially offset the pressure on profitability.In addition, the rating agency expected that Pakistani banks will maintain ample liquidity and continue to benefit from large volumes of low-cost and stable customer deposits.""The Pakistani banks deposit-based funding structure remains a credit strength. We expect inflows of remittances from migrant workers will continue to drive the growth in bank deposits and support banks funding bases,"" said the asst vice-president of Moody's.While banks will use part of their liquid asset to fund lending, Moodys expected the sector to maintain strong liquidity buffers, with core liquid assets  defined as cash and bank placements  at 12 per cent of total assets and liquid securities, more broadly defined, at 41pc of total assets as of June 2015.                        










 
ewarticle ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ongoing fuel shortage that has led to worsening power blackouts is weighing on its credit worthiness and hindering its ability to meet key reform targets laid out by the IMF, ratings agency Moody´s warned Monday. The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody´s said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt ""will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit negative"". ""Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.""The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody´s, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from ""negative"" to ""stable"" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a ""key driver"" in its decision last year. ""Circular debt"" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country´s oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moody´s warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. ""The government´s targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,"" it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total imports would further weigh on Pakistan´s import bill, it added.                        










 
ewarticle KARACHI: Standard and Poor's on Tuesday revised Pakistan's credit rating outlook from stable to positive and forecast higher GDP growth for 2015 to 2017, amid a stint of economic reforms.In a statement, the agency said the country had made significant progress in stablising its economic, fiscal and external performance, alongside eased financing conditions.We are therefore revising the outlook on the long term ratings on Pakistan to positive from stable, the agency said, affirming a B- rating.S&P also revised its earlier average growth estimates for 2015 to 2017 to 4.6 percent from 3.8 percent.This reflected strong capital inflows and remittances, and lower oil prices, which support business confidence and investment spending, it said.Pakistans GDP grew by 4.1 percent in the fiscal year ending June last year.Net foreign exchange reserves with the central bank reached $12.36 billion dollars in recent weeks from just $3.2 billion in January 2014.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has voiced satisfaction with Pakistans progress on reforms required under a $6.6-billion bailout agreed in 2013.The loan came on condition that Pakistan  which was suffering an energy crisis  would carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.In March, Moodys upgraded Pakistans dollar bonds rating one notch from stable to positive.Pakistan has been trying to boost its flagging economy since Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was elected nearly two years ago.                        










"
Current trends in oil prices and US stockpile data,"strong>TOKYO: Oil prices fell on Tuesday as concerns mount that a rally since January is fizzling out, while analysts forecast another rise to record levels for US crude stockpiles.</strongUS oil CLc1 was down 30 cents at $39.09 a barrel at 0553 GMT, after finishing down 7 cents at $39.39, the previous session.Brent LCOc1 fell 35 cents to $39.92. On Monday it settled down 17 cents at $40.27 a barrel.US commercial crude oil stockpiles were expected to have reached record highs for a seventh straight week, while refined product inventories likely fell, a preliminary Reuters survey showed late on Monday.The poll of eight analysts, taken ahead of weekly inventory reports from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA), estimated, on average, that crude stocks rose 3.2 million barrels in the week ended March 25.The API will release its data on Tuesday at 2030 GMT, while the EIA will publish its data on Wednesday at 1430 GMT.Both oil benchmarks are up about 50 percent from 12-year lows hit in mid-February but the oil market has taken on a weaker tone in the past week, along with other commodities.""The numbers continue to suggest a supply glut and I suspect that more talk is relevant out of OPEC and Co to help the price stand up or to help it remain relatively stable,"" said Jonathan Barratt, Chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance in Sydney.He was referring to plans by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major suppliers including Russia to meet next month to discuss an output freeze in the hope they can support prices.The plans for the April 17 meeting in Qatar have been a major component of the rally.But with stockpiles high and signs that some OPEC members are losing market share, along with few signs of demand returning, prices are likely to trade in a range.""The likes of Russia and the likes of Iran ... are cutting deals left right and centre just to get cash flow,"" said Barratt.""Given the absence of economic numbers supporting increases in demand we continue to go sideways,"" he said.Most analysts are predicting the end of the year-and-a-half long slump, but also betting that there is little upside in the near future.Barclays said net flows into commodities totalled more than $20 billion in January-February, the strongest start to a year since 2011, and prices could fall 20 to 25 percent if that were reversed.""Were such a scenario to unfold, the price of oil could fall back to the low $30s,"" it said on Monday. 
ewarticle London: World crude prices diverged Tuesday as traders eyed weak demand and excess supplies, dealers said.Brent North Sea crude for October dropped eight cents to stand at $46.29 a barrel around late afternoon in London.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in October added 86 cents to $44.85 per barrel compared with Monday´s close.Expectations that US crude oil inventories expanded for a third week and news that the OPEC cartel has slashed its demand growth forecast for next year are keeping a lid on any price rally, analysts said.Bloomberg News said it expects US crude stockpiles to have risen by 1.75 million barrels in the week to September 4.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release Wednesday the official stockpiles data, a gauge of demand in the world´s top oil consuming nation.""Prices are unable to make much headway as the market expects US crude stockpiles to expand for the third straight week ahead of the EIA report,"" said Bernard Aw, a Singapore-based strategist at IG Markets.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Monday cut its 2016 forecast for global demand ""due to the projected slower economic momentum in Latin America and China"".The cartel said demand would grow by 1.29 million barrels per day to 94.08 million barrels a day next year, 50,000 barrels less than its previous estimate.Traders are also watching out for the US Federal Reserve meeting this week to see whether policymakers would raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.Analysts say that a hike in the zero-level benchmark rate would likely push the dollar higher, making dollar-priced crude oil more expensive and potentially further damping demand.                        










 
ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices remained near 2016 highs in early trading on Thursday, buoyed by a fall in U.S. crude inventories, a weaker dollar and strong demand, but some analysts warned that the recent rally was starting to look overblown.</strongInternational Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were trading at $52.70 per barrel at 0045 GMT, up 19 cents from their last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was 32 cents higher at $51.55 a barrel.Traders said the price rises were largely a result of a drop in U.S. crude oil inventories.Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. crude stocks last week fell by 3.23 million barrels to 532.5 million barrels, marking their third consecutive weekly fall.A weaker dollar, down around 2.4 percent this month against a basket of other currencies, makes dollar-traded fuel imports for countries using other currencies cheaper, also supporting oil prices, traders said.But some analysts said there were also signs that the recent oil price rise, which saw Brent rally 6 percent this month and prices virtually double since February to one-year highs, may be overblown.ANZ bank said that price rises were ""tempered by an increase in crude production of 10,000 barrels per day to 8.75 million barrels per day and the number of active rigs increasing by 9 to 325"".Traders also warned of an ongoing build in refined product stocks in the United States and Asia.With fundamentals weighing both for and against higher prices, many traders and analysts say that a price tag of $50-60 for a barrel of crude was a fair value for oil, reflected in Brent's forward curve which stays within that range until early 2021. 
ewarticle New York: Oil prices fell on Wednesday before the release of a report on US crude inventories as traders kept an eye on unrest in crude exporter Libya.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in March shed $1.39 to $52.14 a barrel compared with Tuesday´s close.European benchmark Brent oil for April delivery slid $2.00 to $60.53 a barrel in London.The US Department of Energy will release its weekly stockpiles report on Thursday with many analysts expecting another large rise in stocks.Last week´s report showed that US crude inventories reached their highest levels on record for this time of the year.""The market had a very nice rebound from the $44-45 low it made a little while back,"" said Kyle Cooper, analyst at IAF Advisors in Houston.""But the fundamentals are still on the downside, and expectations are for a crude oil build"" on Thursday.""I don´t think the production growth is going to slow in the next couple of months.""Although leading producers like Chevron and ConocoPhillips have slashed capital budgets in light of the more than 50 percent plunge in global crude prices, the cuts are not expected to significantly affect short-term production levels.Traders were also keeping an eye on developments in north African crude oil producer Libya.Infighting and sabotage in Libya has reduced output to 150,000 barrels a day, down from a high of almost 1.5 million barrels per day, according to analysts.

They still remain near their highest levels on record, however.""Although stockpiles are expected to fall, the crude production level in the US is still on a high side and we expect it to rise further,"" said Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore.Both oil contracts fell sharply Tuesday on worries about the crude oversupply and as the greenback soared against other major currencies, making dollar-priced oil more expensive and denting demand.The dollar strengthened against the euro after a European Central Bank official said the bank would ramp up its asset-purchase stimulus programme in May and June to offset an expected financial market slowdown in the coming months.A robust report on US housing construction also lifted the greenback.""The strengthening of the dollar... was the reason for the three percent decline in crude prices yesterday,"" added Ang.""The subsequent rebound we see today is due to bargain-hunting and the market forces readjusting to normal trading.""

What is the capacity of LNG shipment from Qatar that arrived in Karachi?,"strong>KARACHI: Managing Director Pakistan State Oil (PSO), Sheikh Inamul Haq Tuesday announced that the import of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from Qatar will begin from the first week of March.</strongIn a media statement, the MD PSO said Pakistan will import 400 mmcf LNG per day from Qatar.Last week Pakistan and Qatar inked an agreement for supply of around US one billion dollars worth of LNG to Pakistan annually to help the country meet its energy shortfall.The agreement on Long Term LNG Sale and Purchase was signed during the visit of Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharifs two-day visit to Qatar. 
ewarticle KARACHI: A shipment of 147,000 cubic feet of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from Qatar arrived at the Karachi anchorage on Thursday in a Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU).The FSRU, after going through clearance, is expected to dock at Engro Corporation´s Elengy Terminal Pakistan Limited (ETPL), where the cargo will undergo ´regasification´ before being injected into the Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) network.The SSGCL is then required to transfer it to the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) at the Zamzama-Sawan gas establishment.The LNG will initially be provided to four Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in Punjab, including Kot Addu Power Company (Kapco). In the second phase of the operation, fuel will be used for Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and in the third, it will be supplied to the fertiliser sector.

ewarticle CAIRO/ISLAMABAD: State-run Gulf energy company Qatargas is in the final stages of talks on a deal to supply Pakistan with 3 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) annually for 15 years, industry sources in Doha told Reuters on Wednesday.The deal would help the country tackle serious energy shortages and power cuts which can last up to 20 hours a day. Nearly half the countrys electricity is generated by gas and its output of 4.1 billion cubic feet per day is well short of demand for as much as 6 billion, depending on the time of year.One source said the deal would be signed in weeks, while a second said the first shipment would be received by March.An official at the Ministry of Water and Power confirmed an LNG deal was planned but declined to give details. No-one at Qatargas, the world´s largest LNG producer, was available to comment.Pakistan State Oil (PSO) said payments to Qatar would be guaranteed by the government so any cash flow problems at PSO would not affect the Qatargas deal.

How did the Asian stock markets perform after the US economic data release?,"Hong Kong: Most Asian markets rose Friday, taking a positive lead from Wall Street where the Nasdaq broke a 15-year-old record high, while the euro ticked higher ahead of a key eurozone meeting to discuss Greece´s debt crisis.Oil prices edged down after another rally that has been fuelled by worries that unrest in Yemen could hit Middle East supplies.Hong Kong added 0.45 percent, Sydney rose 1.19 percent and Seoul gained 0.23 percent while Singapore put on 0.41 percent and Taipei jumped 1.35 percent.However, Tokyo slipped 0.55 percent and Shanghai lost 0.68 percent.With few catalysts in Asia, investors tracked their US counterparts, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq passed its previous record high set at the peak of the dot-com boom.The index added 0.42 percent to finish at 5,056.06, finally making up the nearly 4,000 points lost in a stunning crash that followed the previous closing high set on March 10, 2000.The Dow gained 0.11 percent and the S&P added 0.24 percent.Thursday´s advances came despite official data showing fresh claims for US unemployment insurance benefits edged up marginally, while sales of new homes plunged in March after a sharp rise in February.The figures will further muddy the waters for the Federal Reserve as it debates when to hike record-low interest rates. On forex markets the dollar eased to 119.50 yen from 119.55 yen in New York late Thursday as expectations for an early summer hike narrow following several below-par US readings lately.The euro bought $1.0814 and 129.25 yen against $1.0823 and 129.39 yen in US trade.However, the single currency is still up from the $1.0703 and 128.28 yen in Tokyo earlier Thursday ahead of the meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Latvia´s capital Riga later in the day to talk about Greece.The Eurogroup meeting comes with Athens running out of cash and struggling to reach a bailout reform deal with its creditors that will unlock billions of euros to service its debts to avert a default and likely exit from the eurozone.However, Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management said that while there is optimism an agreement can be reached ""in reality the rebound in (the euro) reflects short covering ahead of the meeting"".Oil prices dipped on profit-taking after sharp gains Thursday that came as a Saudi Arabia-led coalition renewed airstrikes against rebels in Yemen.While Yemen is not a major producer, it sits on a key strategic entry point into the Red Sea through which some 4.7 million barrels of oil pass each day.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell 23 cents to $57.51 while Brent dipped 25 cents to $64.60.On Thursday WTI gained $1.58 and Brent advanced $2.12.Gold fetched $1,193.36 against $1,189.92 late Thursday.

U.S. financial markets were closed for a national holiday but globally-traded U.S. stock futures rose 1.5 percent.""It is partly a reaction after such big falls last week. Solid U.S. data is also improving investor sentiment given that they are counting on U.S. growth to lead the global economy,"" said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.U.S. retail sales data published on Friday showing firm growth allayed fears - at least for now - that the U.S. economy could be dragged into recession as growth stumbles in many parts of the world.Sentiment on the U.S. currency also improved, with the dollar rising to 114.65 yen, recovering further from a 15-month low of 110.985 touched on Thursday.The euro also eased to as low as $1.1128 on Monday, retreating from Thursday's 3 1/2-month high of $1.1377, and last stood at $1.1173.The common currency was also driven lower by remarks from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that the bank is ready to ease policy further in March.Gold extended fall from Thursday's one-year peak of $1,262.90 per ounce as safe-haven buying in the precious metal in recent weeks was rolled back.It fell 0.6 percent to $1,203.90, unable to find a floor after 2.2 percent on Monday, which was its biggest fall in almost seven months.Oil prices gained on news of a rare private meeting of top officials from the world's biggest oil producers spurred speculation of an eventual deal to tackle a deep supply glut.Global benchmark Brent futures rose 3.3 percent to $34.48 a barrel, rising to their highest level in a week.

impact of Yemen conflict on oil prices,"London: Oil prices fell Friday after spiking the previous day as Saudi Arabian jets struck rebel targets in Yemen, sparking supply fears in the crude-rich Middle East.Brent North Sea crude for delivery in May sank 63 cents to $58.56 a barrel in London midday deals.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for May slid 81 cents to $50.62 a barrel.""Oil prices ... are shedding some of the strong gains they had achieved over the two previous days,"" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.""It would appear that the initial panicky response to Saudi Arabia´s military intervention in Yemen is giving way to a more sober assessment of the situation.""Prices rose sharply on Wednesday and Thursday after a Saudi Arabia-led coalition bombed Huthi rebels in support of Yemen´s embattled President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi.WTI struck a one-month high of $52.48 and Brent jumped to a March 9 peak of $59.78 on Thursday.However, the market has since pulled lower owing to no disruption to oil supplies.Yemen is bordered by key Middle East oil producers Saudi Arabia and Oman.""Oil prices have cooled ... as the initial panic over the consequences of Saudi Arabia´s military action in Yemen and the harm it might cause its oil distribution have failed to materialise,"" added analyst Alistair McCaig at traders IG.Yemen has been gripped by turmoil since the rebels launched a power takeover in Sanaa in February.Warplanes from the Saudi-led coalition kept up raids against Huthi rebels on Friday as Hadi headed to an Arab summit to garner support as Iran warned the intervention was ""dangerous"".""The recent developments in Yemen have caused oil prices to jump on fears of disruption to supplies,"" said research house Capital Economics in a commentary.There are concerns that an escalation of the conflict could disrupt oil shipments passing through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, located between Yemen and Djibouti and through which about 3.8 million barrels of oil per day are transported, it added.Other analysts said the impact of the Yemen crisis on the market was tempered by the crude oversupply, which has been fanned by record US stockpiles and the OPEC cartel´s refusal to slash production.""Despite all this increase, we continue to see weak oil fundamentals and thus, find it extremely hard for current prices to persist,"" said Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore.

Saudi Arabia exported just shy of eight million barrels of crude oil per day in March -- the highest export volume in more than nine years,"" said analysts at Commerzbank in a note to clients on Tuesday.Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets Singapore, said ""global oversupply with weak demand"" continues to put a cap on prices despite geopolitical unrest raising concerns about a disruption in the Middle East.He said the crude market is already ""used to"" unrest in the region, where Islamic State fighters on Sunday captured the key Iraqi city of Ramadi.Yemen is also engulfed in violence that analysts fear could escalate and draw in neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are backing the warring factions.Yemen is not a major oil-producing country, but its coast forms one side of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the key strategic entry point into the Red Sea through which some 4.7 million barrels of oil pass each day on ships headed to or from the Suez Canal.""Fears that the fighting in Iraq and Yemen could hamper the oil supply have clearly given way to a more sober appraisal, for the past twelve months have demonstrated that such concerns are exaggerated,"" Commerzbank analysts added. ""In actual fact, the oil supply from the region has continued to grow.""Oil supplies from leading OPEC producers Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are already near their highest levels in three decades, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week. Crude futures have fought back a little in recent weeks after prices plummeted more than 60 percent between June and January, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries refused to cut production despite a global glut.The move by the 12-nation OPEC cartel, which pumps about 30 percent of global crude, was widely taken as an attempt to push US shale producers, which have higher costs, out of the market.

""This is why we´ve seen the precipitous drop in prices in the last few minutes.""The end of four weeks of air strikes against the Huthi rebel forces, with the coalition saying the rebels´ threat to Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries had been removed, eased concerns about the spreading unrest in Yemen.Although Yemen is not a particularly important oil producer, market watchers have been worried about the impact of the turmoil on the oil-rich region, notably in Iran, which is suspected of supporting the rebellion.Expectations for Wednesday´s weekly inventories report from the US Department of Energy were bearish. The country´s historically high crude inventories were estimated to have increased by 2.5 million barrels in the week ended April 17, according to a Bloomberg News survey of experts.Oil prices have shed about half their value since last June amid a supply glut and weak demand growth.For many analysts, recent gains in oil prices were mainly the result of speculative buying by investors betting that the fundamentals of supply and demand would improve. News last week of a slight decline in US oil production had boosted prices.""There is no fundamental explanation for the price spike,"" Commerzbank analysts said in a research note Tuesday.

But investor confidence appeared to have returned as the bourse recovered today.

current oil price trends and impact of potential Iran nuclear deal,"NEW YORK: Crude-oil prices fell Thursday after six world powers and Iran announced they had agreed on a framework to curb Irans nuclear drive.With the tentative deal, if confirmed, likely to allow Iran crude exports back on the markets, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in May, the global benchmark contract, slumped $2.15, settling at $54.95 a barrel in London trade.The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for May delivery, shed 95 cents to close at $49.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Traders have been following the marathon negotiations closely. Shortly before the New York market closed, the world powers and Iran said that Tehran has agreed to curtail its nuclear program in return for the lifting of US and European Union nuclear-related sanctions that have harmed its economy.Lifting sanctions could open up the flow of Iranian crude to an oversupplied global market. The glut has pushed crude prices more than 50 percent lower since last June.The outline of the deal marked a major breakthrough in a 12-year standoff between Iran and the West, which has long feared Tehran wants to build a nuclear bomb. Iran has insisted the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.At the beginning of the press conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, the price of WTI, which had been trading lower since the market opened, fell to $48.11 a barrel before paring its losses.The countries announced the drafting of a full agreement would begin immediately, with a June 30 deadline for completion.The sanctions would be lifted after the UN atomic agency verifies Iran has fulfilled the terms of the deal.The so-called P5+1 group  the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany  hope that the deal will make it virtually impossible for Iran to make nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian program.Commerzbank analysts, citing shipping sources, said earlier this week that Iran has at least 30 million barrels of crude oil in storage onboard tankers that could quickly move onto the market if sanctions were lifted.Iran has the world´s fourth-largest oil reserves. The OPEC member´s crude exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million bpd because of the US-EU sanctions.Traders also kept an eye on the latest Baker Hughes count of US crude-oil drilling rigs, looking for clues that the strong US crude output could be easing. The count fell by 11 rigs from last week, and the number of operating rigs has fallen more than 50 percent since October.                        










 
ewarticle London: Oil prices fell Tuesday, with profit-taking in evidence a day after the market rallied on doubts over an agreement with Iran over the crude producer´s nuclear programme, traders said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in May dropped 64 cents to $51.50 a barrel compared with Monday´s close. Brent North Sea crude for May lost 46 cents to $57.66 in midday trade.The contracts had surged by three dollars each on Monday.""The current decline in oil prices is most likely due to profit-taking,"" Ken Hasegawa, energy trading manager at Newedge Group, told AFP. Analysts attributed the steep gains on Monday to investors concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.""Most traders were waiting on Iran nuclear talks to cause a flood in Iranian oil as sanctions get lifted,"" said Daniel Ang, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore. ""However, the tone from the US seems firm and this means that sanctions would only be lifted slowly,"" he added.Iran has the world´s fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the US-EU sanctions, which were put in place to prevent it building a nuclear bomb.

ewarticle strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices hit their lowest since 2003 on Monday, as the market braced for a jump in Iranian exports after the lifting of sanctions against the country at the weekend.</strongThe UN nuclear watchdog on Saturday said Tehran had met its commitments to curtail its nuclear programme, and the United States immediately revoked sanctions that had slashed the OPEC member's oil exports by around 2 million barrels per day (bpd) since their pre-sanctions 2011 peak to little more than 1 million bpd.""Iran is now free to sell as much oil as it wants to whomever it likes at whatever price it can get,"" said Richard Nephew, program director for Economic Statecraft, Sanctions and Energy Markets at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.Iran is ready to increase its crude exports by 500,000 bpd, its deputy oil minister said on Sunday.In what traders described as a knee-jerk reaction, international Brent crude fell to $27.67 a barrel early on Monday, its lowest since 2003, before recovering to $28.56 by 0208 GMT, still down over 1 percent from its settlement on Friday.US crude was down 27 cents at $29.15 a barrel, after hitting a 2003-low of $28.36 earlier in the session.""The lifting of sanctions on Iran should see further downward pressure on oil ... in the short term,"" ANZ said on Monday.""Iran's likely strategy in offering discounts to entice customers could see further downward pressure on prices in the near term,"" the bank added.Trading data shows that short positions in US crude markets, which would profit from further price falls, have hit a fresh record despite steep recent drops.While this could trigger sudden price jumps once traders close positions to cash in from further drops, it also indicates that many market participants think there is still more downside to prices.Iran's potential new exports come at a time when global markets are already reeling from chronic oversupply as producers pump a million barrels or more of crude every day in excess of demand, pulling down crude prices by over 75 percent since mid-2014 and by over a quarter since the start of 2016.And although analysts expect Iran to take some time before being able to fully revive its export infrastructure, suffering from years of underinvestment during the sanctions, it does have at least a dozen Very Large Crude Carrier super-tankers filled and in place to sell into the market.The oil price rout is also hurting stock markets, with Asian shares set to slide to near their 2011 troughs on Monday, stoking further worries about a global economic downturn.""Growth keeps slowing ... Lower commodity prices, including oil, partly reflect weakening demand itself. In addition, the downturn in mining capex and the declining income of commodity producers is weighing on exports from Asia,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC, Hong Kong. 
ewarticle SINGAPORE: Oil prices fell on Monday as traders focused on whether Iran and six world powers would reach a deal that could add fuel to an already oversupplied market if sanctions against Tehran are lifted.The two sides are trying to reach an agreement in nuclear negotiations by a Tuesday deadline.""Any relaxation of Iran oil sanctions could see increased exports adding to swelling global supplies and further pressuring prices,"" ANZ said.Brent crude futures were down 42 cents at $55.99 by 0633 GMT as the market began to price in a potential deal with Iran. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was down 84 cents at $48.03 a barrel.Barclays said that the U.S. build-up in stocks would make its way into an already oversupplied market in the second quarter and that global demand would unlikely be strong enough to support oil prices once that happens.""In OECD Asia, demand growth actually fell from -3 percent to -4 percent (in Q1) ... Apparent demand in China was around 2 percent higher, but actual demand is likely to be lower since seasonal stockbuilding typically takes place after the start of the year,"" the bank said. It added that demand growth in the OECD region had been in structural decline over the past five years.""Continued dollar strength is (also) a headwind to the oil price recovery,"" Barclays said, forecasting the dollar rising slightly above parity with the euro by Q4.A potential climb in prices could come from an OPEC production cut, which some members have lobbied for but its biggest exporter Saudi Arabia has resisted.""Saudi Arabia had to cut its price in Asia to ensure its crude oil remained attractive,"" energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said.""Other suppliers looking to position themselves in Asia will have to pay close attention to the Saudi's pricing strategy,"" it added.Morgan Stanley said that crude demand would also be dented via the refinery sector, where production tends to fall towards the middle of the year.In the United States, the oil rig count continued to drop, although analysts said that lower drilling activity would only affect oil production later this year.""The current rig count is pointing to U.S. production declining slightly sequentially in 2Q15 and 3Q15,"" Goldman Sachs said although it added activity could bounce back in 2016 as drillers benefitted from falling production costs.                        










 
ewarticle Singapore: Oil prices rose in Asia Tuesday, three days before an OPEC meeting in which the cartel is expected to maintain high output levels despite a global supply glut.Analysts say the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is likely to focus more on maintaining market share against competitors than on slashing production in order to lift prices.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in January was up 29 cents to $41.94 and Brent crude for January was trading 18 cents higher at 44.79 a barrel at around 0300 GMT.""Crude oil remained on the soft side as many expect OPEC to be unwaving about its production target when the group gathers this Friday,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.""Crude prices are likely to stay sideways ahead of the OPEC meeting, where Iran is expected to announce plans to expand output.""Iran is expected to increase its oil exports after crippling western sanctions are lifted under a landmark deal reached with major world powers in July to curb its nuclear programme.The sanctions have restricted Iranian oil shipments and analysts say their return to the market will further add to the crude oversupply.Iran´s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said last week his country expects the deal to come into force in early January, when Tehran will have implemented its commitments.Oil prices have been in retreat from levels above $100 a barrel reached in mid-2014, with the decline accelerating after OPEC´s November 2014 meeting signalled the group would keep output high.A key measure of China´s manufacturing activity dropped to its weakest level in more than three years in November, data released Tuesday showed, further underlining weaknesses in the world´s top energy consumer.The official Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which tracks activity in the crucial factories and workshops sector, fell to 49.6, the government statistics bureau said. It was the fourth consecutive month of decline and the lowest figure since August 2012.
