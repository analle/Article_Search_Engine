Impact of Beijing's potential monetary policy easing on Asian markets,asian shares wobble after china rate cu,"Hong Kong: Asian stocks flip-flopped on Wednesday after China cut interest rates in a bid to restore confidence in its sagging economy, with trading volatile after days of heavy swings across world equities.The dollar edged up in Tokyo, after rebounding from this week´s steep losses in New York as nervous investors searched for safety.Tokyo rose 0.40 percent by the break, bouncing after their worst two-day plunge since 2011, and Seoul added 1.05 percent as China´s move to cut rates and free up cash for banks to lend spurred optimism.But Shanghai swiftly gave up gains in opening deals to fall 3.03 percent by mid-morning, and Hong Kong and Sydney both dropped 0.70 percent.China on Tuesday cut its key interest rate and slashed the amount of money banks must hold in reserve for the second time in as many months in a bid to spur growth and end its worst stock market rout in decades.The People´s Bank of China has already cut interest rates five times since November to spur the slowing economy as concerns mount it may miss its seven percent growth target for the year.Fears of stalling growth in China, the world´s number two economy and key driver of world growth, has sent global markets into a tailspin and investors said the cuts alone may not be enough to stem the losses.""The authorities have not been intervening, they have been allowing stocks to go down in price.

Impact of political uncertainty in Greece on Asian financial markets,asia stocks boosted by greek debt deal ,"Hong Kong: Asian markets rallied and the euro held up Wednesday on hopes of a settlement in Greece´s debt stand-off after it emerged that the country will ask for an extension to its bailout and avoid a painful eurozone exit.Another record close on Wall Street also provided support, although trade was thin with some markets closed and others winding down for the Lunar New Year holiday.Tokyo rose 0.84 percent, Hong Kong added 0.21 percent, Sydney put on 0.61 percent and Singapore was 0.41 percent higher.Shanghai, Seoul and Taipei were closed for public holidays.Greek public television said Tuesday that the new government will apply for further aid from its European partners, although will not sign up to the painful austerity measures imposed on the country.And in an interview with German public broadcaster ZDF Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said: ""We should extend the credit programme by a few months to have enough stability so that we can negotiate a new agreement between Greece and Europe.""The news will come as a relief after two eurozone finance ministers´ meetings in the past week both collapsed without agreement as Athens refused to continue with the bailout that imposed swingeing spending cuts and tax hikes.The apparent change of face also comes days before its financial lifeline package expires, which would leave the country without any cash and unable to pay its bills, leading it to default and almost certainly leave the eurozone.Investors bought up the euro on the reports and it held the gains in Asia. The single currency fetched $1.1404 and 136.02 yen Wednesday, slightly down from $1.1413 and 136.13 yen in New York afternoon but well above the $1.1357 and 134.70 yen quoted in Tokyo earlier Tuesday.The dollar fetched 119.29 yen from 119.29 yen in New York and 118.55 yen in Tokyo on Tuesday.US shares resumed their record-breaking run Tuesday after they were closed Monday for a public holiday.The S&P 500 climbed 0.16 percent to a second straight all-time high, while the Dow added 0.16 percent.

current trends in US oil prices and market predictions 2023,Oil prices near 2016 hig,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices remained near 2016 highs in early trading on Thursday, buoyed by a fall in U.S. crude inventories, a weaker dollar and strong demand, but some analysts warned that the recent rally was starting to look overblown.</strongInternational Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were trading at $52.70 per barrel at 0045 GMT, up 19 cents from their last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was 32 cents higher at $51.55 a barrel.Traders said the price rises were largely a result of a drop in U.S. crude oil inventories.Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed U.S. crude stocks last week fell by 3.23 million barrels to 532.5 million barrels, marking their third consecutive weekly fall.A weaker dollar, down around 2.4 percent this month against a basket of other currencies, makes dollar-traded fuel imports for countries using other currencies cheaper, also supporting oil prices, traders said.But some analysts said there were also signs that the recent oil price rise, which saw Brent rally 6 percent this month and prices virtually double since February to one-year highs, may be overblown.ANZ bank said that price rises were ""tempered by an increase in crude production of 10,000 barrels per day to 8.75 million barrels per day and the number of active rigs increasing by 9 to 325"".Traders also warned of an ongoing build in refined product stocks in the United States and Asia.With fundamentals weighing both for and against higher prices, many traders and analysts say that a price tag of $50-60 for a barrel of crude was a fair value for oil, reflected in Brent's forward curve which stays within that range until early 2021."

The worst may be over for commodity markets,"" ANZ bank said."

Why is there a petrol shortage in Pakistan?,petrol shortage in several parts of paki,"KARACHI: A strike called by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association has caused a severe shortage of petrol in Karachi, Quetta and several parts of the country.The shortage comes as the government notified a decrease of Rs 3 per litre in the prices of petrol and diesel from Tuesday. Chairman Petroleum and CNG Association Shabir Sulemanji said earlier today that 30 percent of fuel stations in Karachi have run out of petrol and diesel due to the strike, expressing hope that situation would improve by Wednesday.But Geo News correspondent Ali Imran said that by now petrol was available on only about 20 to 25 percent pumping stations  those too most likely on the outskirts of Karachi. He said that there were also reports of fuel stations illegally selling petrol in black at exorbitant rates of up to Rs100 per litre.Read more: Prices of petrol, diesel slashed by Rs3 per litre Some parts of Sindh and Punjab have also begun to feel the effect of the shortage, with fears that the shortage may spiral out of control. The strike by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association, called to protest against sales tax imposed on transportation of oil, is being seen as the main reason for the shortage which is causing great difficulty for consumers.Experts and observers say the effects of the shortage are exacerbated by pumping stations not keeping enough stock and consumers waiting for prices to go down to refill their fuel tanks.

upcoming ECB policy meeting and quantitative easing impact on the euro,dollar at 12 year peak vs euro emerging markets spooked,"LONDON: The US dollar hit multi-year highs against the euro and yen on Tuesday on the growing chance of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by mid-year, the prospect of which also hurt stocks and currencies from emerging markets.The skittish mood spread from Asia to Europe where stocks were down for a second day despite the European Central Bank's new bond buying campaign continuing to push down the euro and the bloc's already record-low borrowing costs.Driving the dollar up was speculation that the Federal Reserve, in contrast, will start lifting interest rates from mid-year after another round of stellar jobs data on Friday and a subsequent chorus of hawkish Fed policymaker comments.The euro's woes were compounded by worries about Greece as euro zone finance ministers met in Brussels a day after the head of the group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, urged Athens to ""stop wasting time"" and start implementing reforms.Selling in the euro had gathered pace again in Europe as a break below a major layer of chart support at $1.0762 to $1.0735 left bears eyeing 1.07 the figure and some mulling potential parity.The dollar also broke higher on the yen in Asia to reach 122.02, territory not visited since July 2007.""It is all about the Fed now,"" said Aurelija Augulyte senior FX strategist at Nordea in Helsinki. ""The ECB (bond buying) bias has now been fully digested, but what the market is now trying to do is price in earlier Fed rate hikes.""The prospect of rising US yields threatened to draw funds away from emerging markets, causing strains from Brazil to Turkey.

Federal Minister for Finance Senator Ishaq Dar chaired the meeting and approved the export of 1.2 million tons of wheat out of the surplus stocks available in Punjab and Sindh.Accordingly, Punjab will export 800,000 tons while Sindh has been allocated export quota of 400,000 tons of wheat. Punjab will get a subsidy of Rs55 per metric ton for export while for Sindh this subsidy would be Rs45 per metric ton.Taking notice of unhindered import of wheat byproducts, the ECC also issued instructions for immediate ban on their import.The ECC considered a proposal moved by the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (Safron) and approved the provision of 30,000 tons of wheat to the United Nations World Food Programme for distribution among Temporarily Displaced Persons (TDPs), catering for the period up to March 2015.The ECC also observed that in case of further requirements, Safron could revert to the forum with a fresh proposal.The ECC considered and approved a proposal by the Water and Power Minstry to attract private sector investment in transmission line projects with the inclusion of upfront tariff as an option. The ECC also accorded approval for the extension of GSA between OGDCL and Fauji Kabirwala Power Company Limited (FKPCL) for provision of 20 mmcfd of gas at the earliest but not later than February 1.

What are the implications of King Salman's succession on Saudi Arabia's oil policy?,new saudi king seen holding line on opec policy to keep oil output hig,"SINGAPORE: Saudi Arabia's new king is expected to continue a policy of keeping oil output steady to drive out rival producers, though the royal succession has focused market attention on the future of the kingdom's long-serving oil minister.King Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court in the world's top oil exporter said in a statement.Salman named his half-brother Muqrin as heir, rapidly moving to forestall any succession crisis at a moment when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders.While the new king is not seen as likely to change Abdullah's policies of keeping output high to protect the OPEC cartel's market share, some analysts said the succession has focused attention on the future of the oil minister Ali Al-Naimi.""King Abdullah was the architect of the current strategy to keep production high and force out smaller players instead of cutting,"" said John Kilduff, partner, Again Capital LLC in New York, adding that he expected Salman to keep production high.FGE analyst Tushar Bansal said: ""By and large, as of now, no major change is expected in Saudi policies"" but he said the market would focus on whether the oil minister might step down.""Ali Al-Naimi has been the oil minister since 1995... It was reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him to stay on for as long as he is around. So, the real question is, if there is a new oil minister soon, will it lead to a change in Saudi energy policy?""IHS oil consultant Victor Shum said speculation over the fate of the oil minister could add to market uncertainty though he did not expect a change of minister or in overall policy.""The decision on Saudi Arabia to keep pumping (oil) was made regardless of who the king may be,"" said Shum.Saudi leaders were also unlikely to want to repeat some previous policy misfires.In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its own output to prop up prices in the face of falling demand and rising supplies from non-OPEC suppliers but was dealt a double blow from lower prices and reduced output.Saudi policymakers would be determined not to make the same mistake again, analysts said.Crude oil futures jumped on Friday after news of the Saudi king's death but later came off their highs and were still trading at levels more than 50 percent below their most recent peaks in June, 2014.

Impact of fuel shortages on Pakistan's economy and credit rating,pakistan fuel crisis weighing on credit worthiness moody,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ongoing fuel shortage that has led to worsening power blackouts is weighing on its credit worthiness and hindering its ability to meet key reform targets laid out by the IMF, ratings agency Moody´s warned Monday. The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody´s said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt ""will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit negative"". ""Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.""The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody´s, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from ""negative"" to ""stable"" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a ""key driver"" in its decision last year. ""Circular debt"" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country´s oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moody´s warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. ""The government´s targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,"" it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total imports would further weigh on Pakistan´s import bill, it added.

Euro gains against dollar after Greek election,euro maintains gains asia stocks adv,"Hong Kong: The euro extended its gains against the dollar Tuesday while Asian equities climbed on hopes Greece´s new government will be able to negotiate a bailout deal with the EU and IMF that will avoid it leaving the eurozone.Regional investors took their lead from advances in Europe and New York, where news of Sunday´s Greek election win for anti-austerity party Syriza had been largely factored in, analysts said.Tokyo jumped 1.44 percent by lunch, Sydney added 0.67 percent, Shanghai edged up 0.10 percent, Seoul rose 0.46 percent and Hong Kong was flat.Markets have been buoyed by rhetoric coming out of Athens and its creditors that raises hopes they two sides can reach an agreement over Greece´s repayment of its 240-billion-euro bailout.Syriza had campaigned on renegotiating terms of the lifeline -- which included swingeing spending cuts and painful tax hikes -- and there are concerns it will default on its repayments, leading to its possible exit from the eurozone.But International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said she was prepared to continue its financial support to the country, while some European finance ministers suggested they were willing to talk, as long as Syriza did not demand its debt be wiped out.The messages coming out of Europe helped shares higher. In Europe, equities in London, Paris and Germany all closed with healthy gains, although Athens lost more than three percent.Dow edged 0.03 percent higher, the S&P 500 added 0.26 percent and the Nasdaq put on 0.29 percent.""The Greek elections had the potential to unnerve the market,"" Nader Naeimi, at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.""It´s quite encouraging that the new government and the EU are willing to negotiate.

How are Islamic banks in Pakistan addressing profitability and customer rewards?,sbp warns islamic banks to be more equitab,"KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor on Thursday urged the country´s Islamic banks to develop ways to reward their customers in line with a surge in the sector´s profitability, or face regulatory action. Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industry´s share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be ""reasonably rationalised"", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits.""Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue,"" said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lion´s share of financing by the country´s Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent. Murabaha is often criticised for lacking economic substance and its resemblance to a conventional loan.

US Justice Department investigation into Moody's mortgage ratings,us probes moodys rating agency,"NEW YORK: US authorities are investigating the credit rating agency Moody's over its glowing assessments of mortgage deals in the runup to the 2008 financial crisis, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.Citing people familiar with the situation, the newspaper said Justice Department officials had met with several former Moody's executives. It wasn't yet clear if the probe would result in a lawsuit.If the investigation is confirmed, Moody's would become the second major US credit-rating firm in the Justice Department's crosshairs, after a case against Standard & Poor's.S&P is expected to within days agree to pay $1.37 billion to settle lawsuits over its rosy grading of mortgage bonds in the financial crisis, sources told AFP.Neither Moody's nor the Justice Department were immediately reachable for comment Sunday.US authorities are probing whether the firm compromised its standards to score deals, the Journal reported, and the focus is on residential mortgage deals from about 2004 to 2007.Positive ratings on what turned out to be extremely risky mortgage deals, known as subprime loans, were a main cause of the 2008 financial collapse.Investors rely on rating firms' grades to assess risk.Numerous banks have already paid huge fines and settlements for their roles in packaging and selling the bonds as low-risk, solid investments.

What were the allegations against HSBC's Swiss subsidiary regarding tax evasion?,hsbc admits swiss bank failings over client tax,"LONDON: British bank HSBC Holdings Plc admitted on Sunday failings by its Swiss subsidiary, in response to media reports it helped wealthy customers dodge taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets.""We acknowledge and are accountable for past compliance and control failures,"" HSBC said on Sunday after news outlets including French newspaper Le Monde and Britains The Guardian published allegations about its Swiss private bank. The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing ""significantly lower"" standards of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report that the files showed HSBC's Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw bricks of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having had ""a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable tax obligations.""Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone ""a radical transformation"" in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC's Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC's Swiss private bank. HSBC said Falciani downloaded details of accounts and clients at the end of 2006 and early 2007. French authorities have obtained data on thousands of the customers and shared them with tax authorities elsewhere, including Argentina.Switzerland has charged Falciani, who Reuters was unable to reach for comment, with industrial espionage and breaching the country's secrecy laws. Falciani has previously told Reuters he is a whistleblower trying to help governments track down citizens who used Swiss accounts to evade tax.Some of the details of the list have been released before. The names of 2,000 Greeks with HSBC accounts was made public in 2010 and dubbed the ""Lagarde List"" after former French finance minister Christine Lagarde. France passed the names to Greece to help it crack down on tax evasion.

Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations,"" said the IEA in its monthly report, which sharply revised up output estimates for the end of last year and forecasts for the start of 2015.The IEA hiked its demand forecasts for every quarter this year, with the annual 2015 figure bumped up by 100,000 barrels per day to 93.5 mbpd, compared with its previous forecast given last month.In earlier Asian trading, the oil market had risen on news of a deal to end a strike at US refineries.Crude futures had fallen Thursday after a government report showed surging US stockpiles, adding to a global oversupply.The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said inventories hit a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week, while stockpiles at the Cushing terminal hub in Oklahoma -- the price settlement point for WTI -- also increased.Bloomberg News meanwhile reported the United Steelworkers union representing 30,000 US oil workers had reached a tentative deal on a four-year contract with Royal Dutch Shell that could see a mass walkout brought to a close.Another development affecting the market was an announcement on Monday by the US Energy Information Administration raising its crude production forecast this year to 9.35 million barrels per day from 9.30 million.

What measures has Ishaq Dar announced to address the revenue shortfall in Pakistan?,Ishaq Dar unveils budget for 2016 2017,"strong>ISLAMABAD: Government is targeting a 16 percent rise in tax revenues in the year ending June 2017, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said on Friday as he unveiled a budget.</strongIn his budget speech in the parliament, he said Pakistan would target a fiscal deficit of 3.8 percent of gross domestic product for the coming financial year, down from the 4.3 percent envisaged for this year.He said the aim was to push Pakistan´s persistently low tax-to-GDP ratio to above 10 percent and raise revenues from taxation to 3.95 trillion rupees ($37.8 billion)from 3.42 trillion this year.The minister presented a review of governments performance over the last three years during which he said the country achieved economic stability.Economic indicators reflect our performance, Dar said. I am thankful to Allah that we are given an opportunity to present budget for fourth time. Our each budget was better than the previous ones.We have successfully managed to put Pakistan on the right track. The finance minister told the House that the countrys GDP growth stood at 4.7 pc. While on the path to economic prosperity, the government has managed to put inflation in check, he added.Revealing his governments performance on the economic front, Dar said tax collection stood at record high. However, exports showed a major decline, but for the finance minister, it was mainly due to a global downward trend that should be blamed.He said pension of federal government employees would be increased by 10 percent while employees over 85 years of age would get 25 percent raise.The minister also announced 50 percent increase in conveyance allowance for grade 1-5 employees.He expressed hope to meet Rs3104bn tax revenue target.He said exports stood at 18.2 billion dollars with 11 percent decrease between july-2015-2016 as compared to 20.5 billion dollars in the same period in 2012-13 , mainly due to Decline in Global Comodities Prices.The minister said imports stood at 32.7 billions dollars between July-April 2015-16 as compared to  33 billion dollars in the same period in 2012-13.A 40 percent increase was recorded in imports of machinery which shows an increase in investment.Appreciating services of Pakistani expatriats, he said Pakistans foreign remittances soared to 16 billion dollars during July-April 2015-16 as compared to 11.6 billion dollars during the same period in 2012-13. strong>GROWTH</strongstrong>REVENUE</strongstrong>SUBSIDIES</strong strong>DEFENCE BUDGET</strongstrong>TAXATION</strong     "
What are the new tax increases and regulatory duties introduced by the Pakistani government?,pakistan aims to raise 379 million in new taxes to meet imf targ,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan must raise an extra $379 million (about Rs40 billion) through new tax measures, the finance minister said on Monday, as the government seeks to qualify for its latest IMF loan tranche.Earlier this month, the IMF approved the release in December of a $502 million tranche of Pakistan´s three-year $6.68 billion programme, even though the government missed targets for tax revenue generation, net domestic assets and the budget deficit.The government will levy an additional 5 to 10 percentage points of tax on 350 items and raise customs duty by 1 percentage point, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said at a press conference in the federal capital.The full list of items was not immediately available.The increased levies would target ""non-essential luxury items"" only, and exemptions on the customs duty have been offered for 25 key industrial sectors, Dar said on Monday.""We have kept in mind not to increase duties that would make items more expensive for the common man,"" he said.Separate increased taxes were also announced on imported automobiles - both new and used - and domestically-produced cigarettes.In its last review, the International Monetary Fund had warned that the release of December´s approved $502 million tranche depended on the announcement of new measures to generate an extra 40 billion Pakistan rupees ($380 million) in revenue. ""This was a deadline in a sense, and if the government didn´t do it the next tranche of the programme would at least be delayed, if not suspended,"" Khurram Husain, an economic analyst and journalist, told Reuters.It was unclear if the new measures would meet the target.Dar had earlier told a parliamentary standing committee that the increased duties were meant to restrict Pakistan´s import bill, not increase revenue.Husain said if the measures did not raise enough funds, the government would have to raise taxes on staples such as electricity and petrol.

current trends in oil prices and stockpile levels,Oil prices fall as concerns rise over rally petering ou,"strong>TOKYO: Oil prices fell on Tuesday as concerns mount that a rally since January is fizzling out, while analysts forecast another rise to record levels for US crude stockpiles.</strongUS oil CLc1 was down 30 cents at $39.09 a barrel at 0553 GMT, after finishing down 7 cents at $39.39, the previous session.Brent LCOc1 fell 35 cents to $39.92. On Monday it settled down 17 cents at $40.27 a barrel.US commercial crude oil stockpiles were expected to have reached record highs for a seventh straight week, while refined product inventories likely fell, a preliminary Reuters survey showed late on Monday.The poll of eight analysts, taken ahead of weekly inventory reports from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA), estimated, on average, that crude stocks rose 3.2 million barrels in the week ended March 25.The API will release its data on Tuesday at 2030 GMT, while the EIA will publish its data on Wednesday at 1430 GMT.Both oil benchmarks are up about 50 percent from 12-year lows hit in mid-February but the oil market has taken on a weaker tone in the past week, along with other commodities.""The numbers continue to suggest a supply glut and I suspect that more talk is relevant out of OPEC and Co to help the price stand up or to help it remain relatively stable,"" said Jonathan Barratt, Chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance in Sydney.He was referring to plans by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major suppliers including Russia to meet next month to discuss an output freeze in the hope they can support prices.The plans for the April 17 meeting in Qatar have been a major component of the rally.But with stockpiles high and signs that some OPEC members are losing market share, along with few signs of demand returning, prices are likely to trade in a range.""The likes of Russia and the likes of Iran ... are cutting deals left right and centre just to get cash flow,"" said Barratt.""Given the absence of economic numbers supporting increases in demand we continue to go sideways,"" he said.Most analysts are predicting the end of the year-and-a-half long slump, but also betting that there is little upside in the near future.Barclays said net flows into commodities totalled more than $20 billion in January-February, the strongest start to a year since 2011, and prices could fall 20 to 25 percent if that were reversed.""Were such a scenario to unfold, the price of oil could fall back to the low $30s,"" it said on Monday."

Nearly half the countrys electricity is generated by gas and its output of 4.1 billion cubic feet per day is well short of demand for as much as 6 billion, depending on the time of year.One source said the deal would be signed in weeks, while a second said the first shipment would be received by March.An official at the Ministry of Water and Power confirmed an LNG deal was planned but declined to give details. No-one at Qatargas, the world´s largest LNG producer, was available to comment.Pakistan State Oil (PSO) said payments to Qatar would be guaranteed by the government so any cash flow problems at PSO would not affect the Qatargas deal.

U.S. crude was up 75 cents at $49.44.Analysts are expecting a rise in crude stocks of 2.6 million barrels.But another drop in U.S. crude stocks would reinforce the view that the supply glut that has been weighing on prices since 2014 is easing. The API data, however, does not always tally with the EIA data, which is due at 1430 GMT.""All eyes now turn to the EIA crude inventory numbers,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA in Singapore, adding that another confirmed drawdown in crude stocks would likely push U.S. crude prices above $50.Brent has risen from below $49 on Sept. 28, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed a surprise cut in its output to support prices which are less than half the level of mid-2014.Under the deal, OPEC will target production of between 32.50 million barrels per day (bpd) and 33.0 million bpd, implying a cut of as much as 740,000 bpd from the August level, as reported in OPEC's monthly report.The move marked an about-face by OPEC, which in November 2014 dropped its role of cutting production. Although it hasn't yet worked out all the details, and analysts are skeptical the cut will be implemented, the deal is supporting the market.""The mere threat of a production cut should put a floor under oil prices until the next OPEC meeting on Nov. 30,"" said Jason Gammel of U.S. investment bank Jefferies."

With Brent up 8 percent since Monday and WTI 12 percent higher since April 18, this week is set for some of the steepest price rallies so far this year, and crude is up by more than two-thirds since its 2016 lows between January and February.Traders said that sentiment in the entire commodity complex had turned more confident, with new cash being put into the market by investors, lifting prices.Another factor has been producers taking advantage of higher prices by locking in production. ""We would expect producers in the U.S. taking every opportunity to aggressively hedge as soon as there is opportunity when oil prices recover for short periods of time,"" French investment bank Natixis said.Falling output, especially in the United States, where many producers are shutting down following an up to 70 percent price<br/>rout since 2014, is also helping to lift the market.Natixis said it expected U.S. oil production to drop by at least 500,000 to 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, compared with 2015, and by another 500,000 bpd in 2017.Despite the recent rally, oil markets remain oversupplied as<br/>between 1 and 2 million barrels of crude are being pumped out of the ground every day in excess of demand, leaving storage tanks around the world filled to the rims with unsold fuel."

The KASA 1000 project is among the major electricity transfer projects in the region, based on which 1,300 megawatts of electricity from Kazakhstan and Tajikistan is expected to be transferred to Afghanistan and Pakistan.He said that Tajikistan wished to enhance bilateral trade with Pakistan and invited the business community to visit his country to explore investment opportunities and organise trade exhibitions. He added that the energy sector of Tajikistan had been showing sustainable growth for the last 15 years transforming the country into the worlds third largest producer of hydroelectric power after the US and Russia. Jononov went on to say that hydroelectric generation accounted for 76 percent of the total energy output of the country and the total cost of the project which would lighten Pakistan through Tajik electricity will be financed by the World Bank, ADB, Islamic Development Bank and other donors.He also said that this project would not only alleviate electricity shortages in Pakistan but would also replace fuel based electricity generation for Afghanistan and Pakistan, adding that it would also establish Afghanistan as a viable transit country and offer transmission capacity for other countries during the off peak season.He further said that it would also create a viable governance mechanism to build confidence among neighbours as major share of the export will be used by Pakistan and approximately 300 MW will be utilised by Afghanistan.

current trends in global oil prices 2023,oil prices edge higher,"London: Oil prices nudged higher on Friday, further recovering from a steep dive seen mid-week, although demand is set to remain shackled by a global supply glut, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in May edged up one cent to $50.80 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for May gained 27 cents to $56.84 around midday in London.WTI and Brent sank 3.6 percent on Wednesday after the US Department of Energy said commercial inventories in the world´s biggest economy hit a record high last week.That came after Saudi Arabia´s Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said his country´s production had hit an all-time high of 10.3 million barrels a day in March.Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group, has said this week that rising imports of US crude oil could indicate improved demand prospects in the world´s largest oil consumer or concerns about supply tightening.Price support has meanwhile come from events concerning major oil producer Iran.Analysts attributed steep gains at the start of the week to investors concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.The United States on Thursday warned that sanctions on Iran will be lifted in stages as a nuclear deal is implemented, after Tehran demanded they be removed as soon as it comes into force.""Geopolitical factors remain a constant worry for investors with concerns regarding Iran´s nuclear programme potentially leading to ongoing volatility in the crude oil market,"" said Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokerage.

What was the impact of China's central bank interest rate cut on Hong Kong stocks?,asian shares wobble after china rate cu,"Hong Kong: Asian stocks flip-flopped on Wednesday after China cut interest rates in a bid to restore confidence in its sagging economy, with trading volatile after days of heavy swings across world equities.The dollar edged up in Tokyo, after rebounding from this week´s steep losses in New York as nervous investors searched for safety.Tokyo rose 0.40 percent by the break, bouncing after their worst two-day plunge since 2011, and Seoul added 1.05 percent as China´s move to cut rates and free up cash for banks to lend spurred optimism.But Shanghai swiftly gave up gains in opening deals to fall 3.03 percent by mid-morning, and Hong Kong and Sydney both dropped 0.70 percent.China on Tuesday cut its key interest rate and slashed the amount of money banks must hold in reserve for the second time in as many months in a bid to spur growth and end its worst stock market rout in decades.The People´s Bank of China has already cut interest rates five times since November to spur the slowing economy as concerns mount it may miss its seven percent growth target for the year.Fears of stalling growth in China, the world´s number two economy and key driver of world growth, has sent global markets into a tailspin and investors said the cuts alone may not be enough to stem the losses.""The authorities have not been intervening, they have been allowing stocks to go down in price.

""But the big question is, how will they handle Iraq.""Brent crude was up 38 cents at $50.36 a barrel as of 1348 GMT, having risen as high as $50.67 intra-day. U.S. crude gained 28 cents to $49.46.Oil also drew support from the unexpected drop in U.S. crude inventories, and larger than expected falls in stocks of gasoline and distillates, reported this week, which raised hopes that a long-awaited market rebalancing is finally under way.""The global stock overhang must be reduced in order to see higher prices. Whilst such reduction is largely in the hand of OPEC, the re-balancing is already taking place in the U.S.,"" Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM said.The market was keeping an eye on escalating protests in Venezuela against the rule of President Nicolas Maduro, although there was no sign of any impact on the OPEC member's oil output. Venezuelan production has been falling this year as low prices hit investment.Doubts about the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' supply cut deal have been weighing on the market this week.OPEC agreed last month its first deal to restrain output in eight years to boost prices. But Iraq on Sunday called for Baghdad to be exempt, adding to the list of members seeking special treatment.A technical meeting at OPEC's headquarters on Friday, and with officials from non-OPEC countries on Saturday, is supposed to come up with recommendations on how to implement the supply cutback to the oil ministers' next meeting on Nov. 30.The OPEC plan is designed to speed up the removal of a supply glut that is keeping oil prices at less than half their level of mid-2014, cutting exporters' income and leading to investment cuts by oil companies worldwide."

What measures has the FBR taken to improve tax collection in Pakistan?,fbr moves to widen tax net but big fish yet to be caug,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) has begun chasing wealthy tax-dodgers who enjoy lives of extravagance and luxury, but revenue officials face huge challenges in trying to force the very richest  and most influential  to pay up.Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio of 9.5 percent is among the lowest in the world and the government is under pressure from foreign donors and lenders, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to increase collection to boost the struggling economy.Revenue authorities say they have identified about a quarter of a million new taxpayers who they project will add around 14 billion rupees ($140 million) to government coffers.Broadening the tax base and improving the economy after years of drift and sluggish growth under the last government was a key pledge in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif´s 2013 election campaign, when he was swept to power for a third time.Currently less than one percent of Pakistanis pay income tax and the government collected just $8 billion in total income tax in the 2013-14 fiscal year  barely enough to cover just the country´s defence expenditure of $7 billion.The finance ministry is aiming to boost the tax-to-GDP ratio to 15 percent in the current fiscal year ending June 30.As part of those efforts, the FBR is compiling lifestyle and vehicle data to try to trace unregistered taxpayers, including wealthy landlords and businessmen zipping between their luxury homes in imported Mercedes.""We are collecting information from the vehicle registration authority, car manufacturers, utility companies, telecom companies and property registration offices and tracing people who are not paying any tax,"" FBR spokesman Shahid Hussain told AFP.Taxpayer profilesThe data is used to generate profiles of potential taxpayers, after which demands are issued for them to pay income tax.""FBR has already issued notices to 261,250 potential tax payers,"" Hussain told AFP, adding that that new taxpayers have paid 570 million rupees since the crackdown started.It is not just dodgy businessmen who have been caught  several lawmakers have been found paying either no tax or very little and not filing their mandatory annual tax statements.The FBR has taken punitive measures against some ""chronic defaulters"", freezing nearly 300 bank accounts, seizing more than 100 vehicles, putting 78 properties up for sale and issuing arrest warrants in 40 cases.""Employing information technology, the FBR is creating a central database which would contain information about all taxpayers and nobody will be left undetected,"" Hussain said.A new FBR department tasked with broadening the tax net started working in July 2013 and within one year it started showing results, he added.But Pakistan is a country where wealth and political influence go hand in hand. For generations, landowners and industrialists have given patronage to political parties and scant attention has been paid to their assets by the taxman.Changing this privileged arrangement is a tricky proposition.Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for Pakistani daily The News who has done several major exposes on tax-dodgers, says the FBR´s commitment is encouraging, but he does not expect them to net any big fish.´War on tax cheats´""FBR is after those who can´t influence them,"" Cheema told AFP, citing several well-known tycoons considered among Pakistan´s richest whose names were missing from a list of the country´s top 100 taxpayers.""It can be done only by waging a war against tax cheaters without discrimination of good and bad cheaters,"" Cheema said.Pakistan´s central bank said in a recent report that tax revenue growth was not keeping up with budget targets.The tax take grew 11.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, against an annual target of 26.9 percent  but this was only half the growth of the same period during the previous fiscal year, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The central bank has urged the government to simplify tax procedures and do more to increase the documentation of the economy.A vast amount of business in Pakistan is done off the books, making transactions hard to trace and levy dues on.""Although FBR has taken a number of measures to increase tax collection, these focused more on deductions at source, and/or increasing the tax rates,"" a recent SBP report said, warning such measures had enjoyed ""limited success"" in the past.The IMF, though, has said the government´s reform programme  tied to a $6.6 billion loan from the Washington-based lender  was on track, and expects growth to accelerate to 4.3 percent in the 2014-15 fiscal year from 4.1 percent previously.But even with growth quickening and officials insisting they are making inroads, challenges to the government´s efforts to gather taxes remain considerable.

The direction of oil prices is governed by supply and the strength of the dollar,"" said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Sydney's Ayers Alliance.The U.S. dollar index slipped against a basket of currencies on Thursday. A weaker dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities including oil cheaper for holders of other currencies.U.S. crude futures had climbed 12 cents to $44.82 a barrel by 2025 EST, after falling $1.65, or 3.6 percent, in the previous session.Brent crude futures climbed 10 cents to $46.99 a barrel after settling $1.33 lower, or 2.8 percent, at the previous close.That came after U.S. crude inventories rose 2.3 million barrels to 1.221 billion barrels in the week to Aug. 26, data from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday. That compared with analyst expectations of a 921,000-barrel increase.Distillate stocks, which include diesel and heating oil, unexpectedly rose by 1.5 million barrels, while gasoline inventories fell by 691,000 barrels, about half the forecast drawdown.""In the absence of any price shocks, oil prices remain rangebound - as soon as oil gets down to the lower end of $40 a barrel prices find support. When oil gets down to $40-$42 investors buy, when it gets to $48-$50 they sell again"", Barratt said.Speculation the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers might agree to curb output at talks in Algeria later this month helped fuel an 11-percent rise in crude prices in August, the best monthly return since April.But optimism of an output freeze has since waned.""The market is very complacent on whether OPEC can come up with a supply freeze deal.

Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations,"" said the IEA in its monthly report, which sharply revised up output estimates for the end of last year and forecasts for the start of 2015.The IEA hiked its demand forecasts for every quarter this year, with the annual 2015 figure bumped up by 100,000 barrels per day to 93.5 mbpd, compared with its previous forecast given last month.In earlier Asian trading, the oil market had risen on news of a deal to end a strike at US refineries.Crude futures had fallen Thursday after a government report showed surging US stockpiles, adding to a global oversupply.The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said inventories hit a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week, while stockpiles at the Cushing terminal hub in Oklahoma -- the price settlement point for WTI -- also increased.Bloomberg News meanwhile reported the United Steelworkers union representing 30,000 US oil workers had reached a tentative deal on a four-year contract with Royal Dutch Shell that could see a mass walkout brought to a close.Another development affecting the market was an announcement on Monday by the US Energy Information Administration raising its crude production forecast this year to 9.35 million barrels per day from 9.30 million.

Impact of US Federal Reserve comments on dollar value and interest rates,Dollar dips as effect of Fed rise wears off,"strong>Hong Kong: The dollar retreated against most of its major peers and emerging market currencies Wednesday, as analysts predict the Federal Reserve could hold off another hike in borrowing costs until April.</strongAs the effects of last week´s greenback rally -- fuelled by the US central bank´s first rate rise in almost a decade -- wear off, pressure has built on the unit as dealers decide to cash in at the end of the year.With a sense of optimism reappearing in regional markets -- and demand for higher-risk assets -- Asia tracked a rally on Wall Street for a second-successive day, boosting emerging currencies. And a lift in oil prices also supported commodity-based units.The dollar´s losses also come despite upbeat readings on US growth and consumer spending that indicate the Fed´s decision to begin lift-off was well justified.""There´s some paring of outstanding dollar long positions with investors reluctant to carry dollar exposure into the holidays,"" Ray Attrill, co-head of currency strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.""If you want to be at least modestly constructive on the US dollar early next year, which we are at this stage, you´re probably going to need to see the market attaching a higher probability"" to the Fed raising rates in the first quarter, he said.In morning Asian trade the dollar bought 121.03 yen, down from 121.10 yen in New York Tuesday and well off the levels above 123 yen touched last week. The euro was at $1.0950 against $1.0954 but sharply up from the $1.0830 mark last week.Australia´s dollar rose 0.04 percent against the US unit, while the South Korean won was 0.2 percent higher and Taiwan´s dollar gained 0.1 percent. There were also increases for the New Zealand and Canadian dollars as well as the Thai baht."

Impact of China's PMI on global oil prices,oil drops as saudi output nears record china demand worries drag,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices dropped on Tuesday after activity in China's factory sector fell to an 11-month low and as Saudi Arabia said its production was close to an all-time high.The flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 49.2 in March, below the 50-point level that separates growth in activity from a contraction on a monthly basis, stoking worries over the strength of the world's No.2 economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 50.6.""Considering that the preliminary PMI figures for major crude importers turned out much lower than estimates ... we expect both WTI and Brent to end-off today lower,"" Singapore-based Phillip Futures said on Tuesday.The PMI drop in China followed an overnight report that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, was now pumping around 10 million barrels of crude oil per day, a near all-time high and some 350,000 bpd above the figure Saudi Arabia gave to OPEC for its February output.""The market was under pressure early in the trading day after comments from Saudi Arabia that it was producing almost 10 million barrels per day,"" ANZ bank said on Tuesday.Brent crude oil futures were trading down 47 cents at $55.45 a barrel at 0750 GMT. U.S. WTI crude dropped 65 cents to $46.80 a barrel.Worries over slowing growth in China's economy as well as high production have contributed to a global surplus in oil supplies.""We expect crude prices to be pressured once again by the weight of some 2 million barrels per day of oversupply in Q2 2015,"" energy consultancy FGE said in a note on Tuesday.The refinery sector has benefited from cheap oil, which has improved margins for oil products such as diesel or jet fuel.""A sharp decline in crude prices over late 2014 and into January 2015, followed by an extraordinarily cold February (in the United States and parts of Europe), has meant good times for refiners,"" FGE said, but it added that high refinery margins were unlikely to last.""In H2 2015, we see an oversupplied products market even as crude prices begin to recover. Refinery margins will adjust downwards.""

Moody's rating upgrade for Pakistan's dollar bonds,moodys upgrades pakistan bond rating,"KARACHI: Moodys upgraded Pakistans dollar bonds rating one notch from stable to positive on Wednesday on the back of the countrys improving macroeconomic indicators.The financial ratings firm said its decision came in view of Pakistans strengthening foreign exchange reserves.Pakistan has been trying to boost its flagging economy since Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was elected nearly two years ago.""Moody´s Investors Service has revised the outlook on Pakistan´s foreign currency government bond rating to positive from stable,"" the company said in a statement.Pakistan issued $1 billion in five-year Sukuk Bonds, the Islamic version of eurobonds, in November last year to boost foreign exchange reserves.In April 2014, the country issued $2 billion worth of eurobonds, in five and 10 year terms,Pakistan´s net foreign currency reserves with the central State Bank reached to $11.2 billion up to March 13, from just $3.2 billion in January 2014.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has voiced satisfaction with Pakistan´s progress on reforms required under a $6.6-billion bailout agreed in 2013.The loan came on condition that Pakistan -- which was suffering an energy crisis -- would carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody´s said continued success under the IMF programme would act as ""upward triggers to the rating"".The central State Bank of Pakistan on the weekend slashed its benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point to eight percent.The bank noted that the economy was now on a more stable footing and was benefiting from the drop in world oil prices.

Current trends in oil prices and US stockpile data,Oil prices fall as concerns rise over rally petering ou,"strong>TOKYO: Oil prices fell on Tuesday as concerns mount that a rally since January is fizzling out, while analysts forecast another rise to record levels for US crude stockpiles.</strongUS oil CLc1 was down 30 cents at $39.09 a barrel at 0553 GMT, after finishing down 7 cents at $39.39, the previous session.Brent LCOc1 fell 35 cents to $39.92. On Monday it settled down 17 cents at $40.27 a barrel.US commercial crude oil stockpiles were expected to have reached record highs for a seventh straight week, while refined product inventories likely fell, a preliminary Reuters survey showed late on Monday.The poll of eight analysts, taken ahead of weekly inventory reports from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA), estimated, on average, that crude stocks rose 3.2 million barrels in the week ended March 25.The API will release its data on Tuesday at 2030 GMT, while the EIA will publish its data on Wednesday at 1430 GMT.Both oil benchmarks are up about 50 percent from 12-year lows hit in mid-February but the oil market has taken on a weaker tone in the past week, along with other commodities.""The numbers continue to suggest a supply glut and I suspect that more talk is relevant out of OPEC and Co to help the price stand up or to help it remain relatively stable,"" said Jonathan Barratt, Chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance in Sydney.He was referring to plans by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major suppliers including Russia to meet next month to discuss an output freeze in the hope they can support prices.The plans for the April 17 meeting in Qatar have been a major component of the rally.But with stockpiles high and signs that some OPEC members are losing market share, along with few signs of demand returning, prices are likely to trade in a range.""The likes of Russia and the likes of Iran ... are cutting deals left right and centre just to get cash flow,"" said Barratt.""Given the absence of economic numbers supporting increases in demand we continue to go sideways,"" he said.Most analysts are predicting the end of the year-and-a-half long slump, but also betting that there is little upside in the near future.Barclays said net flows into commodities totalled more than $20 billion in January-February, the strongest start to a year since 2011, and prices could fall 20 to 25 percent if that were reversed.""Were such a scenario to unfold, the price of oil could fall back to the low $30s,"" it said on Monday."

How did the Asian stock markets perform after the US economic data release?,asian stocks mostly up after record on wall ,"Hong Kong: Most Asian markets rose Friday, taking a positive lead from Wall Street where the Nasdaq broke a 15-year-old record high, while the euro ticked higher ahead of a key eurozone meeting to discuss Greece´s debt crisis.Oil prices edged down after another rally that has been fuelled by worries that unrest in Yemen could hit Middle East supplies.Hong Kong added 0.45 percent, Sydney rose 1.19 percent and Seoul gained 0.23 percent while Singapore put on 0.41 percent and Taipei jumped 1.35 percent.However, Tokyo slipped 0.55 percent and Shanghai lost 0.68 percent.With few catalysts in Asia, investors tracked their US counterparts, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq passed its previous record high set at the peak of the dot-com boom.The index added 0.42 percent to finish at 5,056.06, finally making up the nearly 4,000 points lost in a stunning crash that followed the previous closing high set on March 10, 2000.The Dow gained 0.11 percent and the S&P added 0.24 percent.Thursday´s advances came despite official data showing fresh claims for US unemployment insurance benefits edged up marginally, while sales of new homes plunged in March after a sharp rise in February.The figures will further muddy the waters for the Federal Reserve as it debates when to hike record-low interest rates. On forex markets the dollar eased to 119.50 yen from 119.55 yen in New York late Thursday as expectations for an early summer hike narrow following several below-par US readings lately.The euro bought $1.0814 and 129.25 yen against $1.0823 and 129.39 yen in US trade.However, the single currency is still up from the $1.0703 and 128.28 yen in Tokyo earlier Thursday ahead of the meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Latvia´s capital Riga later in the day to talk about Greece.The Eurogroup meeting comes with Athens running out of cash and struggling to reach a bailout reform deal with its creditors that will unlock billions of euros to service its debts to avert a default and likely exit from the eurozone.However, Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management said that while there is optimism an agreement can be reached ""in reality the rebound in (the euro) reflects short covering ahead of the meeting"".Oil prices dipped on profit-taking after sharp gains Thursday that came as a Saudi Arabia-led coalition renewed airstrikes against rebels in Yemen.While Yemen is not a major producer, it sits on a key strategic entry point into the Red Sea through which some 4.7 million barrels of oil pass each day.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell 23 cents to $57.51 while Brent dipped 25 cents to $64.60.On Thursday WTI gained $1.58 and Brent advanced $2.12.Gold fetched $1,193.36 against $1,189.92 late Thursday.

current oil price trends and impact of potential Iran nuclear deal,global oil prices fall as iran nuclear framework reached,"NEW YORK: Crude-oil prices fell Thursday after six world powers and Iran announced they had agreed on a framework to curb Irans nuclear drive.With the tentative deal, if confirmed, likely to allow Iran crude exports back on the markets, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in May, the global benchmark contract, slumped $2.15, settling at $54.95 a barrel in London trade.The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for May delivery, shed 95 cents to close at $49.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Traders have been following the marathon negotiations closely. Shortly before the New York market closed, the world powers and Iran said that Tehran has agreed to curtail its nuclear program in return for the lifting of US and European Union nuclear-related sanctions that have harmed its economy.Lifting sanctions could open up the flow of Iranian crude to an oversupplied global market. The glut has pushed crude prices more than 50 percent lower since last June.The outline of the deal marked a major breakthrough in a 12-year standoff between Iran and the West, which has long feared Tehran wants to build a nuclear bomb. Iran has insisted the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.At the beginning of the press conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, the price of WTI, which had been trading lower since the market opened, fell to $48.11 a barrel before paring its losses.The countries announced the drafting of a full agreement would begin immediately, with a June 30 deadline for completion.The sanctions would be lifted after the UN atomic agency verifies Iran has fulfilled the terms of the deal.The so-called P5+1 group  the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany  hope that the deal will make it virtually impossible for Iran to make nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian program.Commerzbank analysts, citing shipping sources, said earlier this week that Iran has at least 30 million barrels of crude oil in storage onboard tankers that could quickly move onto the market if sanctions were lifted.Iran has the world´s fourth-largest oil reserves. The OPEC member´s crude exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million bpd because of the US-EU sanctions.Traders also kept an eye on the latest Baker Hughes count of US crude-oil drilling rigs, looking for clues that the strong US crude output could be easing. The count fell by 11 rigs from last week, and the number of operating rigs has fallen more than 50 percent since October.
